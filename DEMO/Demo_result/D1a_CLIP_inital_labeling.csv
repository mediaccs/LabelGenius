Fashion & Style,"On This Runway, Non-Models and Cool Kids",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/fashion/eckhaus-latta-casting-new-york-fashion-week.html,"Over Labor Day weekend, a steady stream of hopefuls arrived at Eckhaus Latta's basement studio in Chinatown for the chance to take an audition strut down a makeshift runway.

New York Fashion Week was days away, and Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta, the designers of Eckhaus Latta, and their casting director, Rachel Chandler, were surveying the talent (male, female and nonconforming) hoping to appear in their fashion show on Sept. 10.

Eckhaus Latta is an anomaly among the trendy sportswear labels that otherwise populate New York Fashion Week. Mr. Eckhaus and Ms. Latta, both 28, founded it in 2011, straight out of the Rhode Island School of Design, where neither had studied fashion (he, sculpture; she, textiles). And it maintains an air of art school (there is much talk of various ""creative practices"" and their ""process-oriented"" praxis).

Their designs have been exhibited at the hipper museums of the coasts -- at MoMA PS1, in New York, and the Hammer Museum, in Los Angeles -- and their shows often have the flavor of an old-school ""happening."" (Their last show was held at PS1, at 9:30 p.m., on a weekday night mid-fashion week, in a snowstorm. Hundreds turned up anyway.)",How the Eckhaus Latta designers select fashion week's coolest cast.,e9cd6477-5eb6-58b2-8e33-fd2d881bf656,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/10/fashion/10ECKHAUS-WEB1/10ECKHAUS-WEB1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=650df93b3e54b1d21163675e9fbff3d34391b30c94d95df3894a16482eec6e6d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mike Eckhaus, center right, and Zoe Latta, center left, of the fashion label Eckhaus Latta.",e9cd6477-5eb6-58b2-8e33-fd2d881bf656,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1e9cd6477-5eb6-58b2-8e33-fd2d881bf656.jpg,19,19
Theater,"The New 42nd Street, a Theater Nonprofit, Names Its Next Leader",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/theater/new-42nd-street-russell-granet.html,"The New 42nd Street -- the nonprofit organization behind the New Victory Theater, the New 42nd Street Studios and the Duke on 42nd Street -- has named Russell Granet as its new president and chief executive officer.

Until May, Mr. Granet was the acting president of Lincoln Center, where he had run the education and community engagement division and served in other leadership roles. He will start at the New 42nd Street in July. ""I couldn't imagine a better position or a better place to work,"" Mr. Granet said in an interview .

Mr. Granet will follow on the heels of the organization's longtime leader Cora Cahan, who is stepping down after about 29 years. Under her tenure, in the 1990s, the organization spearheaded the restoration of seven historic theaters on 42nd Street and helped to transform the street into a cultural hub . The New 42nd Street also opened three spaces in the area: the family theater the New Victory, which offers shows for children at prices sometimes as low as $2; the New 42nd Street Studios, which gives emerging artists a much-sought-after rehearsal site to create new work; and the Duke, a black-box theater available for rental.

Mr. Granet said that as leader of the New 42nd Street, he'll focus on commissioning new work. He said he will prioritize offering the New 42nd Street Studios as an incubator space for projects by emerging artists and using the Duke to stage those works.","Russell Granet will be the new president and chief executive of the organization, taking over as Cora Cahan steps down.",acdcd1ef-71a9-55f2-9993-7a231d57396f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/11/arts/11new42-item/11new42-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=51f9691b9923b0bc48ba24502080cef57ea96e060732b95f66a0814323950174&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The New 42nd Street board chairwoman, Fiona Rudin, with Russell Granet.",acdcd1ef-71a9-55f2-9993-7a231d57396f,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1acdcd1ef-71a9-55f2-9993-7a231d57396f.jpg,10,10
Economy,Tax Tactics Threaten Public Funds,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/business/economy/multinational-tax-strategies-put-public-coffers-at-risk.html,"When the European Commission charged this week that Ireland's sweetheart tax treatment of Apple amounted to an illegal corporate subsidy, the company said that it had done nothing wrong. Apple executives might have added that whatever they did, they were not alone. Corporate tax strategies intended to minimize global taxes, by hook or by crook, are by now standard practice. Google and Facebook move money through Ireland to lower their taxes. Starbucks uses the Netherlands, a practice that is under review by Europe as well. ""The commission picked up a case which is quite common in terms of tax planning,"" said Pascal Saint-Amans, who runs the Center for Tax Policy and Administration at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the policy advisory organization of the world's advanced nations. The question is whether this sort of strategy -- as common to multinational companies as filing a tax return every year -- can truly be stopped. What hangs in the balance is whether governments can continue to tax corporations beyond the barest minimum. Or whether globalization will make such taxation all but impossible.

""A combination of greater economic integration and more income accruing to intangibles like intellectual property, which by nature are hard to locate, does raise profound questions for the future of taxation,"" said Lawrence H. Summers, Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and President Obama's first chief economic policy adviser. ""It is a significant problem for the revenue capacity of states and an immense problem for their capacity to maintain progressive taxation."" If corporations can continue to evade taxation -- using strategies like sham transactions between phantom subsidiaries to shift profits to the lowest tax jurisdictions and costs to where taxes are highest -- the burden of public finance will land almost entirely on the shoulders of ordinary workers, the only link in the economic chain that can't move. ""Consider a superstar banker, an enormously valuable pharmaceutical patent, a terrific entertainer, an assembly line worker and a teacher. Of all those things, which is the least mobile?"" asked Mr. Summers. ""A tax system that can't reach the mobile is a tax system that is going to burden working people."" Some scholars -- including Robert B. Reich, who served as Labor Secretary during the Clinton administration and now teaches at the University of California, Berkeley; and Greg Mankiw of Harvard, who was former chief economic adviser to President George W. Bush -- have proposed abolishing the corporate income tax, replacing it with direct taxes on shareholders. But it is highly doubtful that the American political system could raise taxes on dividends, capital gains and upper incomes enough to compensate for the lost revenue from business. Rich taxpayers also have their own sophisticated tools to shield income, including parking money in tax havens around the world.

Mr. Saint-Amans said he feared that without the corporate income tax, income taxation would fall apart entirely as the wealthy could avoid taxation by becoming companies, inserting several corporate layers between themselves and their money. Nobody has a confident grasp of the scale of corporate tax avoidance. Corporate tax revenue in the United States today amounts to some 2.6 percent of total economic activity, roughly the same as it did in the early 1980s, when the latest wave of globalization took off. Across the 34 O.E.C.D. nations, corporate tax revenue actually grew from just above 2 percent of G.D.P. in the 1960s to some 3.7 percent in 2007, before the financial crisis walloped companies around the world. These figures can be misleading, though. In the United States, corporate taxes have remained flat despite a sharp increase in corporate profits, which today take the highest share of national income since the government started measuring them in the 1920s. Profits have similarly risen in other industrial countries around the world. Plus, there is plenty of suggestive evidence that profit-shifting has become a core pillar of corporate strategy.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. In 2012 the Irish subsidiaries of American multinationals generated $120 billion in profit, according to United States government data, eight times as much as their German subsidiaries. Subsidiaries in Bermuda generated $82 billion, four times as much as subsidiaries in Mexico.

Americans seem to be the most nimble dodgers. The United States has a higher statutory corporate tax rate than Europe, but according to a recent study by Reuven S. Avi-Yonah of the University of Michigan Law School and Yaron Lahav of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, European multinationals effectively pay a higher rate than their American counterparts. The problem is global. In 2010, according to the International Monetary Fund, Barbados, Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands received more foreign direct investment combined than Germany or Japan. The British Virgin Islands was the second-largest investor in China, after Hong Kong. These fictions are possible because most of the money flows through shell corporations that employ nobody and produce nothing. Can these problems be fixed? ""I think so,"" Mr. Saint-Amans said. ""The golden age of 'We plan aggressively and pay taxes nowhere' is over."" The European Commission's deployment of competition policy to go after dubious tax breaks in Apple's case is a novel and potentially powerful strategy, which could be applied to many other arrangements. Governments in both the rich and poor world are fed up, Mr. Saint-Amans said. Having spent the last few decades drafting rules to prevent double taxation, they are now terrified that they have built a system of double nontaxation instead. Governments that turned a blind eye to the tax avoidance of their multinational champions to give them a competitive edge against foreign rivals are now under enormous pressure from voters to prove that it's not only workers and dupes paying taxes.

The O.E.C.D., Mr. Saint-Amans says, has no business telling countries what tax rate they should impose. If the Irish can fund their government charging companies 12.5 percent, that's their business. Still, he trusts new rules developed by the O.E.C.D., if broadly adopted, could put an end to common avoidance practices, like parking valuable intellectual property in tax havens or having subsidiaries in high-tax jurisdictions, where interest is deductible, borrow from subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions where interest is not taxable. Under enormous pressure from the rest of the world, tax havens might even repent. The Irish, he said, have been mulling tightening the rules unilaterally, concluding that the bad blood generated by the arrangements outweighs the modest number of jobs that they lure and the scant tax revenue that these artificial investments leave in the country. There are reasons, however, to remain cautious that the world's tax collectors can get ahead of its corporate tax strategists. The trend in the United States, if anything, is going in the opposite direction. Despite the Obama administration's new rules to prevent so-called corporate inversions, where companies move their tax residency abroad, companies like Burger King and Medtronic are still dropping their American ""citizenship"" to reduce their tax liability. Ireland has based its entire development strategy on becoming a low tax base for the multinationals of the world. And until the financial crisis walloped its banks, it had been successful. As Mr. Summers pointed out, putting a stop to the shell company shenanigans doesn't automatically put an end to international tax competition. In fact, it might make it worse.","If global corporations can continue to evade taxation, the burden of government financing could fall disproportionately on ordinary workers.",1de5c156-9cea-5971-9fdf-b6a4ce9bf35c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/29/business/eduardo-porter/eduardo-porter-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2014&h=900&w=600&s=e0f5bc829638945c9b9699e41305b013e6fb17053b1c05c78d9b02c6891b47ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Eduardo Porter,1de5c156-9cea-5971-9fdf-b6a4ce9bf35c,Demo_data/D1_imgs/11de5c156-9cea-5971-9fdf-b6a4ce9bf35c.jpg,8,20
Television,Review: 'The Chi' Returns to the South Side of Chicago,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/television/the-chi-review-season-2.html,"""The Chi"" was built around a series of shootings, and the way their repercussions rippled out through the lives of its large cast. But its best material was casual and observational. The testy relationships of the aspiring chef Brandon (Jason Mitchell) with his live-in girlfriend, Jerrika (Tiffany Boone), and his entrepreneurial frenemy Hannibal (Chris Lee) felt fresh. Even more original and entertaining were the story lines involving the middle schoolers Kevin (Alex Hibbert), Papa (Shamon Brown Jr.) and Maisha (Genesis Denise Hale), whose hilariously passive-aggressive pursuit of the mild-mannered Kevin was the show's single best idea.

That first season can be streamed on Showtime's website or through Amazon Prime Video. It's necessary if you're going to understand what's going on in Season 2, and maybe it's sufficient. Because through five episodes of the new season, a lot of the shine is gone from ""The Chi."" The story lines are largely continuous: the fallout from the killing of Brandon's younger brother by the tortured Ronnie (Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine); the strife between the player Emmett (Jacob Latimore) and Tiffany (Hannaha Hall), the mother of his child; Brandon's constantly stymied efforts to get his food-truck business off the ground.

But the urgency has faded from them, partly because of a sense that the bones of Season 1 are being gnawed over for too long, but mostly because the show's sensitivity and unpredictability are, at almost every moment, shading over into conventional melodrama and self-conscious point making. As characters make speeches about fatherhood and police corruption, and we sit through stiff, sentimental flashbacks to Ronnie's stressful return from military duty in the Middle East, the show starts to feel like an earlier Showtime drama set in Chicago, the buppie soap opera ""Soul Food.""

The middle schoolers are still used for comic relief -- selling candy bars to parishioners as they break a fast, engaging in a food fight on school picture day -- but the situations have more of a tinny sitcom quality, and the young actors' performances are correspondingly less joyful. (Hale still makes the most of every minute onscreen, though.) Mitchell and Latimore feel stuck, too, with Brandon's and Emmett's stories taking on a flattened, didactic tone they didn't have in Season 1. The major new twist to the plot, a mystery element apparently involving gentrification, is playing out slowly but already feels forced into what's been a distinctively organic narrative.

The cast turnover between seasons was small, though Sonja Sohn, as Brandon's hard-edge mother, and Steven Williams, as an old-school gangbanger, are missed. The one big change was the replacement of the showrunner Elwood Reid by Ayanna Floyd Davis. Their producing and writing credits aren't dissimilar -- ""The Bridge"" and ""Cold Case"" for Reid, ""Empire"" and ""Hannibal"" for Davis -- and it's never a good idea to place too much credit or blame on one person in the ecosystem of a TV series. But chemistry matters, and in Season 2 the formula's off.",Lena Waithe's neighborhood drama on Showtime didn't get the awards-season attention it deserved for Season 1.

Opinion,Banks Should Face History and Pay Reparations,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/opinion/sunday/banks-reparations-racism-inequality.html,"Ms. Blackwell is founder in residence at PolicyLink, a research and advocacy institute, where Mr. McAfee is the chief executive.





Corporate chief executives have been tripping over themselves to demonstrate their support for racial justice. They've taken a knee, tweeted that black lives matter, donated money to advocacy groups and affirmed their commitment to inclusion. That's all well and good. And following through on their promises -- by hiring and promoting more people of color, diversifying boards and executive suites and paying all workers decent wages and essential benefits -- would be even better. But business leaders who are serious about fighting racism will hold themselves accountable for the bitter inequities they have helped to create and sustain, and from which they have profited. Every industry must now use its power to repair the damage and heal the wounds. The financial industry is a good place to start. Banks have been underwriters of American racism -- no industry has played a bigger or more enduring role in black oppression, exploitation and exclusion. Banks financed the slave trade and in some cases ""repossessed"" humans in bondage.

White-owned banks refused to serve black people who left the South escaping brutality and seeking opportunity during the Great Migration of the early and mid-20th century. Bank policies and practices contributed to segregating every major city and denying black families the two most important toeholds to the middle class -- ownership of homes and of businesses. Federal legislation beginning in the 1960s prohibited the most blatant discrimination in banking and lending. It banned redlining, the practice named for the color-coded maps that lenders used to deny mortgages in black neighborhoods. But banks and real estate agents found ways to exploit the desire of black people to own homes, leaving many in foreclosure. Racial disparities in access to the conventional mortgage market endured, leaving black home buyers vulnerable to fraud and risky loans, as the subprime mortgage fiasco exposed so painfully.

Similarly, banks deny loans to black-owned businesses at twice the rate of white-owned ones. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for small black companies to grow. But the industry doesn't only suppress black wealth, it aggressively strips it, through excessive interest rates on consumer debt, egregious overdraft penalties and higher fees even for simple A.T.M. transactions. It's no surprise that the median black family had roughly one-tenth of the wealth of a white family as of 2016. The gap not only limits education and career options, it's also a source of gnawing anxiety about how the bills will get paid in the event of a job loss or costly illness -- setbacks facing millions of families, again disproportionately black, during the Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, the wealth gap hurts the nation's economy. McKinsey & Company calculates that closing the black-white wealth gap could increase G.D.P. by 4 percent to 6 percent, or more than $1 trillion, by 2028. A federal reparations policy is unlikely to come anytime soon. But banks and financial institutions don't have to wait. First, they must apologize for their culpability for and complicity in structural racism. Next, they must commit to serving black people as they do whites. Then, with these four bold policies, the industry can start to close the wealth gap, repair the harms and serve as a model for a nation struggling to reckon with racism: Americans carry a lot of consumer debt, but as Christian Weller reports in Forbes, nobody bears a heavier burden than African-American families. They are the only racial group that owes more than their belongings are worth -- they could sell all their possessions and they would still be in debt. More from ""The America We Need"" Black families on average had $8,554 in consumer debt in September 2019. And they pay more for debt -- about $735 a year in interest on every $10,000 they borrow, compared with $514 for white families. Because they have less access to conventional banks and the mortgage market, many black families are forced to rely on high-interest alternatives such as payday loans. Additionally, black people are hit with higher bank fines and harsher punishment, including wage garnishment, for loan defaults, making it harder to climb out of debt. Freeing families from the drag of this debt would help them build savings and obtain financial security. Nearly half of black households have limited access to retail banking services or none at all. And black customers who have bank accounts pay more -- $190 more for a checking account -- compared with white customers, according to one study.

That's because banks in communities of color generally require higher opening balances and minimums to avoid fees, and they charge more for A.T.M. transactions and overdrafts. Seemingly small differences in bank fees pay off handsomely for the industry. Of the more than $11 billion that big banks collected last year in overdraft-related fees, the bulk came from just 9 percent of account holders -- consumers who generally have low bank balances, according to a study by the Center for Responsible Lending. Ending these egregious practices would make banking more attractive to black consumers. The long history of blatant racism in mortgage lending is well known. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was supposed to end it. But today, the rate of black homeownership, 43 percent, is barely higher than when that law took effect -- and much lower than white homeownership, at 70 percent. Given the persistent racism in the mortgage market and the subprime mortgage disaster, which not only resulted in homeownership disparities but also limited the value of homes owned by black people, banks must provide interest-free mortgages to black home buyers. These loans could be capped at the regional median loan value and should be in place until black homeownership is on par with white homeownership. Expanding secure homeownership for black families and creating opportunities for them to buy in markets where real estate enjoys healthy increases in value will improve economic mobility and begin to create generational wealth. Black Americans, women especially, start small businesses at higher rates than whites. From 2007 to 2012, the number of black-owned businesses increased nearly 35 percent. But almost all are sole proprietorships or partnerships with no employees, in no small part because they lack access to capital. More than half of black-owned companies are turned down for bank loans, twice the rate of white business owners. Black businesses need investment to grow, especially during the pandemic, yet baked-in racism in the Paycheck Protection Program meant that only 12 percent of black and Latino business owners received the loans they requested.",The financial industry can close the wealth gap and serve as a model for a nation struggling to reckon with racism.,165426ae-1e7c-5193-8596-ef96357645a8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/25/opinion/25ineqWeb/25ineqWeb-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=23b7a6e66e1a2857c85eaee40bf5bf01dfa47a466f49edfac62a5498c3932a79&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Wells Fargo bank in Minneapolis was set on fire during protests against the death of George Floyd.

Books,"Mercedes Barcha, Gabriel García Márquez's Wife and Muse, Dies at 87",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/books/mercedes-barcha-dead.html,"Mercedes Barcha and her husband, the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, in 2007. ""Mercedes permeates all my books,"" Garcia Marquez once said. ""There's traces of her everywhere.""





Mercedes Barcha, the widow, muse and gatekeeper of the Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who played a crucial role in the publication of his breakthrough novel, ""One Hundred Years of Solitude,"" died on Aug. 15 at her home in Mexico City. She was 87. Her death was confirmed by her son Rodrigo Garcia, who said she had suffered from respiratory problems for many years. Mercedes and Gabo, as the couple were known, were living in Mexico City in 1965 when Garcia Marquez began work on ""One Hundred Years of Solitude,"" the hypnotic, time-bending tale of the mythical village of Macondo, based on the area of Colombia where they had both grown up. For more than a decade, Garcia Marquez had been eking out a living as a journalist -- a passionate leftist, he spent a year in the New York office of Prensa Latina, the Cuban press agency -- while banging out short stories and novellas. For 18 months, he had holed up in his office in their home while Ms. Barcha kept the landlord, and the world, at bay. When he emerged in late 1966, he later recalled, she asked: ""Did you really finish it? We owe $12,000.""

She then pawned her hair dryer and the couple's blender so she could pay the postage to send the manuscript to his Argentine editor. The book -- a South American Genesis, as many would call it, or ""an intricate stew of truths and mirages,"" as Garcia Marquez wrote, in which priests levitated and flowers rained from the sky -- would go on to sell nearly 50 million copies. ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" and many of the other novels and collections Garcia Marquez published in the decades to follow would be among the rare literary works to enjoy both popular and critical success. Its themes and characters swirled throughout all his books: savage political violence, passions romantic and otherwise, ghosts, family secrets, idealistic questing madmen and, always, the practical yet mystical women who grounded them -- female avatars inspired in one way or another by Ms. Barcha, a sharp-witted beauty he had fallen for when they were children.

""Mercedes permeates all my books,"" he once said. ""There's traces of her everywhere."" ""He called her the manager of the crisis department,"" their son Rodrigo Garcia said, ""sometimes without him even knowing what the crisis was."" Mercedes Barcha Pardo was born on Nov. 6, 1932, in Magangue, Colombia. Her father, Demetrio Barcha, was a pharmacist; her mother, Rachel Pardo, was a homemaker. The oldest of seven children, Mercedes grew up in Sucre and then Barranquilla, on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where her family moved to avoid the political violence that convulsed the region at midcentury. There, home on holiday from convent school, she re-met Garcia Marquez, who was writing for a local newspaper. As the story goes, he had already proposed marriage the moment he saw her back in Sucre, when she was 9 and he was 14. From the start he found her beautiful and enigmatic, ""with an illusionist's talent for evading questions,"" as he wrote in his 2003 memoir, ""Living to Tell the Tale."" When Garcia Marquez was sent to Europe as a foreign correspondent, he wrote to Ms. Barcha regularly. After his newspaper was shut down, he found himself broke in Paris, living in a hotel room and working on a manuscript. Her photo on the wall and a red Olivetti typewriter were among his only belongings. Upon his return to South America in 1957, he paid Ms. Barcha 500 pesos (the equivalent of about $130, or about $1,200 today) to return his letters -- she wouldn't give them up without a prize -- and promptly destroyed them. ""He was years away from being famous,"" Rodrigo Garcia said, ""but he was always very particular about their lives being private. He didn't want the paper trail."" The two married in 1958. On the day of the wedding, Ms. Barcha waited to put on her wedding dress until he had driven up. ""It's not that she doubted him,"" Mr. Garcia said, ""but she had the superstition and the pragmatism of people from a certain world that said, 'There's a one-in-a-million chance that a bridegroom might not appear for his wedding.' So it was just in case.""

Their friend Jorge Eduardo Ritter, who had been Panama's ambassador to Colombia, described Ms. Barcha as akin to a president's adviser. ""She let him know what he needed to know,"" he said. ""She was more informed than he was, having read all the newspapers while he worked each morning."" If she had neglected to give him money for lunch, Mr. Ritter continued, ""He would say, 'Mercedes didn't give me cash, so you will have to pay.'"" When his novel ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" was published in English in 1988, Garcia Marquez told Pete Hamill, who wrote about him for Vanity Fair: ""You write better with all your problems resolved. You write better in good health. You write better without preoccupations. You write better when you have love in your life. There is a romantic idea that suffering and adversity are very good, very useful for the writer. I don't agree at all."" The couple had homes in Mexico City and Cuernavaca, Mexico; in Barcelona and Paris; in Cartagena and Barranquilla, Colombia; and, rather problematically, in Havana, a so-called protocol house lent them by Fidel Castro, to whom Garcia Marquez remained a loyal friend, confounding almost everyone. Because of their friendship, the United States government denied Garcia Marquez an unrestricted visa until President Bill Clinton, a fan, invited him to Martha's Vineyard in 1995 (although before then he had been issued waivers to receive a visa whenever he wanted to visit the United States). Even in that friendship, apparently, Ms. Barcha had the upper hand. As Garcia Marquez told Jon Lee Anderson of The New Yorker, who profiled him in 1999, ""Fidel trusts Mercedes even more than he does me.""

""It was one of those epic marriages,"" Mr. Anderson said in a phone interview. ""Mercedes ran the practical side. She unmoored him from the quotidian exigencies of everyday life."" Each of their homes, he recalled, was identically decorated, with white furniture and carpets, modern art, the same clothes in the closet and the same Apple computer. ""There's a Spanish phrase: 'polo a tierra,' the thing you ground a house with,"" Mr. Anderson said. ""She was his grounding, his connection to the earth."" ""She was also insatiably curious about the world and its goings-on; they both were,"" he added, ""and they were wise-eyed in this very intrinsic way. They came from a similar part of Colombia, from these little backwater river towns where violence was a fact of everyday life."" Mr. Garcia said his parents ""had this idea of marriage that was also a kind of complicity. It wasn't just the love, it was the things that were just between the two of you. ""People say she was the gatekeeper,"" he continued. ""I think that's a little facile. There is a gatekeeper when there is a gate to be kept.

Opinion,The George Floyd Election,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/george-floyd-trump-biden.html,"Mike Erlandson, a former chairman of the state's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, told Politico that the rioting could convert two relatively safe suburban Minneapolis-St. Paul Democratic House seats into competitive battlegrounds: Both of those districts will be decided in large part by suburban women voters, and it would be hard for me to imagine those people aren't watching this scared, like everybody else, for their family and for their children. What Democrats fear most is a repetition of the voter reaction to urban rioting in the 1960s that brought an end to decades of Democratic hegemony at every level of government as Republicans were able to set much of the federal, state and local agenda for the next 52 years. The transformation of voting patterns that manifested in the 1968 election is documented by Omar Wasow, a political scientist at Princeton. In his May 2020 paper, ""Agenda Seeding: How 1960s Black Protests Moved Elites, Public Opinion and Voting,"" Wasow compared voting in predominately white counties close to violent protests in 1968 to those that were not. Violent protests likely caused a 1.6 percent to 7.9 percent shift among whites toward Republicans and tipped the election. In contrast, the Democratic vote in white counties that directly experienced, or were in proximity to, nonviolent protests rose by 1.6 percent. Based on these calculations, Wasow estimated what the outcome of the 1968 election would have been under a ""counterfactual scenario that Martin Luther King had not been assassinated on April 4, 1968 and 137 violent protests had not occurred in the immediate wake of his death."" Under this scenario, Wasow wrote, ""Hubert Humphrey would have won an additional 763,040 votes nationally,"" including a majority of the votes in five additional states: Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, and Ohio. These swing states would collectively have provided Humphrey with an additional 84 electoral votes and allowed him to win the 1968 election with a total of 275 electoral votes. The current situation not only raises Democratic concerns over a repetition of 1968, but also a repetition of 2016.

They note that other studies have found that political violence is associated with a ""backlash"" effect; voters behave unsympathetically toward the perceived rioting group. In the United States, this means increased support for socially and politically conservative candidates and policies. Ryan, Kaufman and Sands write that reasons for ""the differences between our findings and prior research"" include the possibility that ""a single riot invokes sympathy"" while ""a series of riots provokes backlash."" In addition, ""those observing the riot from afar may lack sympathy because they do not share an identity with the rioters."" Interestingly, the profound levels of partisan polarization that obtain in 2020 are likely to lock voters into support for the candidates of their chosen political party. The freezing of millions of votes before the contest even begins means that a much smaller share of the electorate can be swayed by new developments, making the impact of urban disorder much less than it was in 1968, when voters' attachment to political parties was less intense. In a January 2020 paper, ""Cross-Country Trends in Affective Polarization,"" three economists, Levi Boxell and Matthew Gentzkow, both of Stanford, and Jesse M. Shapiro, of Brown, measured voter polarization from 1978 to 2018. They found that the level of polarization in the United States nearly doubled over those four decades, increasing at a much faster pace than in eight other developed nations, Canada, Switzerland, New Zealand Australia, Britain, Norway, Sweden, and German. While Democrats struggle to capitalize on their strengths and compensate for their vulnerabilities, the most challenging political terrain involves questions of race. Brian Schaffner of Tufts University argues that the current prominence of racially charged issues may cost liberals some votes: November is a long way off, and it is very possible that these protests will be a distant memory by then and that a new coronavirus outbreak or continued economic crisis will be the main talking points as the election nears. Then he added another thought: That said, it's possible that the protests will help Trump. In 2018, Democrats won back some of the Obama-Trump voters, and those Obama-Trump voters that they won back looked like the Democratic base on many issues, but were much farther away from the party's base when it came to issues of race. in general like the Democratic Party's positions on bread and butter economic and social welfare politics, but seem to be less comfortable with the racial justice platform. So elevating the salience of the latter may drive some swing voters back to Trump. Schaffner provided data showing that voters who backed Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016 are close to mainstream Democrats on such issues as banning assault weapons and Medicare for All. They are, however, substantially more conservative that the Democratic base electorate on issues of white privilege and the border wall.

will look at all of the chaos happening in the United States right now -- protests, violence, coronavirus, economic crisis -- and simply decide that Trump is just not up to the job. With the situation as it is, there may be a desire among many to put the country in the hands of an experienced professional politician like Biden. What makes the moment unique is that the combination of widespread racial discontent, the pandemic and the economic implosion is taking place at a time when the scope of deprivation and need is extraordinary. The number of people who are out of work without income now tops 40 million. There is the prospect of an ""avalanche of evictions"" forcing millions of renters into homelessness as legal protections and government assistance come to an end. The University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute estimates that ""42 percent of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss."" Families will increasingly begin to experience the incalculable depth of loss as the election approaches, and traditional political maneuvering will be subordinated to the less familiar and highly volatile politics of scarcity. Scarcity can bring out the best and the worst in us, but with Trump in the White House for the next seven months the likelihood of a beneficial outcome is slim to none. Trump's behavior this week has prompted extreme fear among some of those on the left. ""Authoritarians, often mentally unstable people with deeply narcissistic needs, transform this kind of chaos into dictatorships,"" David Leege, a professor emeritus of political science at Notre Dame, wrote in an email. Leege suggested that the president's actions Monday night offer a parallel to the rise of fascism in the 1930s, when Trump signaled his intent to seize power, sending troops to any state where the governor did not mobilize the forces of order to physically beat back and punish harshly any protesters who did not desist. To model for the nation his strength, he called out the troops to restore order to Washington, D.C. How the protests, both peaceful and violent, will play out on Nov. 3 remains uncertain. Perry Bacon Jr., a senior writer at FiveThirtyEight.com, points out that over the last decade, many whites, especially white Democrats, ""have become increasingly conscious of discrimination against black Americans -- particularly in the years since Trayvon Martin was shot and killed in 2012 and Michael Brown was shot and killed in 2014."" The looting of drugstores and high-end retail -- much of it videotaped and repeatedly broadcast -- may undermine the strength of these emerging liberal convictions. But will that matter more than Floyd's stark death, which also exists on tape for all to see?",How the protests come to be viewed may determine who the next president is. The way that will play out could surprise us.,32d42c23-4bd8-504a-8151-912b4c3f002d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/03/opinion/03edsall1/03edsall1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3d5d07fbba34a3ced9dc75ae7f4e3ab7960b543214faec93c4ef55dc1f9ae24a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Protests over the killing of George Floyd in New York City on Monday.,32d42c23-4bd8-504a-8151-912b4c3f002d,Demo_data/D1_imgs/132d42c23-4bd8-504a-8151-912b4c3f002d.jpg,11,11
Books,"For Black and Mixed-Race Women, Hair and Identity Are Tangled Together",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/books/review/that-hair-djaimilia-pereira-de-almeida.html,"What do we lose in translation? How do we know we're getting the story right? In the Portuguese writer 's slim third novel, ""That Hair,"" this question feels particularly salient, given the nontraditional structure of the narrative. Even in its English translation (from a language that Eric M. B. Becker, the translator, calls ""at odds"" with this one), Pereira de Almeida's semi-autobiographical ""hybrid novel"" is a challenging read. It feels less like a novel than a collection of essays linked together by the author's preoccupation with her hair -- or, rather, the hair of her narrator, Mila. But as anyone blessed to be black knows, one's identity is inextricably wound up in one's hair. Fact or fiction, that is ultimately what this book is all about.

Mila begins by telling us, ""The story of my curly hair intersects with the story of at least two countries and, by extension, the underlying story of the relations among several continents: a geopolitics."" The daughter of a blond Portuguese father and a Black Angolan mother, Mila leaves her native Angola at the age of 3 to live with her paternal grandparents in Lisbon. We learn that Mila's mother has remained in Africa, to visit her daughter only occasionally, but the details about her mother's life, and how this absence unmoors Mila, are frustratingly scarce.

Instead Pereira de Almeida chooses to contextualize Mila's arc using the paths her paternal and maternal grandparents took separately and together, crisscrossing Portugal's African colonies to eventually arrive in Lisbon. It's a fascinating back story, offering a glimpse into the legacy of colonialism, but tracing her ancestors' journeys from Africa to Europe doesn't quite help Mila understand her own place in the world.","In ""That Hair,"" the Portuguese writer Djaimilia Pereira de Almeida uses a young half-Angolan girl in Lisbon to explore her own Afro-European selfhood.",7e7703aa-4180-57a3-9781-c74a25d31afb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/22/books/review/22Tharps1/Tharps1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bfe3c45923c489b7d086330685fb31a4b0e9e7b3c80f6f051fc20d60b5504f2f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Djaimilia Pereira de Almeida,7e7703aa-4180-57a3-9781-c74a25d31afb,Demo_data/D1_imgs/17e7703aa-4180-57a3-9781-c74a25d31afb.jpg,13,20
Books,A Contemporary Feminist Spin on the Traditional Pioneer Novel,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/books/review/madeline-ffitch-stay-and-fight.html,"Motivated in part by guilt as a privileged outsider, Helen invites a local lesbian couple, Lily and Karen, and their newborn son, Perley, to join her on the land. For years they share an insular, antisocial utopia, united by their anticapitalist eagerness to eke out an existence eating boiled nettles and acorns. Forget other people, Lily decides after the three of them construct a ramshackle cabin, which is promptly infested by black snakes: ""It was each other we wanted.""

[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of July. See the full list. ]

Karen and Lily call their parenting style ""dignity of risk,"" and when 7-year-old Perley is bitten by one of the snakes, the family is cast out of paradise and into disarray. Seeing his face wound, the school principal reports the family to Children's Services, whose agents remand the boy to foster care. To get him back, Karen joins an oil-pipeline crew to earn enough cash for court-ordered property improvements. There she discovers the pipeline is headed right for Helen's land, where construction could eventually devastate their land and force them all to flee.

In a 2017 essay for Granta, ffitch recounted her own family's experience attending protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, ominously nicknamed the ""black snake."" She's borrowed that image to serve as the central metaphor of her novel, the snake that bites Perley mirroring the danger of the pipeline that slithers toward Helen's land.

At the novel's climax, the snakes both metaphorical and literal seem poised to destroy this backwoods Eden. An exasperated Karen has quit her crew in defeat; Perley remains in foster care, ""hopped up on some kind of meds."" When Karen firebombs a compressor station that services the pipeline, the act seems less heroic than desperate. ""Too bad that kind of thing doesn't create lasting change,"" Helen remarks upon reading of the eco-sabotage in the newspaper.

In that Granta essay, ffitch described the tension between activism and fiction. ""Rather than claiming certainty or authority where none exists, storytellers stay honest by writing about what we ourselves don't fully understand."" ""Stay and Fight"" succeeds in mapping the obscure psychological and emotional territory that defines a life caught between commitment and ambivalence, between rebellion and resignation.","In Madeline ffitch's debut, ""Stay and Fight,"" an urbane hipster finds herself when she relocates to Appalachia.",c030fbee-2601-54f5-a9df-75fa8c13368c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/27/books/review/Enzinna1/Enzinna1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=226&w=432&s=8ea1d7a80d891280731fa6443cbdef64247d3cc6ad59ae91c14d8289c2f7747e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Madeline ffitch's debut novel, ""Stay and Fight,"" succeeds in mapping the peculiar psychological territory that defines a life caught between commitment and ambivalence.",c030fbee-2601-54f5-a9df-75fa8c13368c,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1c030fbee-2601-54f5-a9df-75fa8c13368c.jpg,13,13
Media,Minnesota Public Radio Drops Garrison Keillor Over Allegations of Improper Conduct,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/business/media/garrison-keillor-fired.html,"Minnesota Public Radio said Wednesday that it was severing all business ties with Garrison Keillor, the creator and retired host of ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" after allegations of ""inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him."" Over four decades, Mr. Keillor, 75, had created a financial juggernaut for the radio network with his weekly broadcast of songs, skits and tales of his fictional hometown Lake Wobegon, along with related books, recordings and other products. In a statement he provided to The New York Times, Mr. Keillor said, ""I've been fired over a story that I think is more interesting and more complicated than the version MPR heard. Most stories are."" Effective immediately, MPR said, it will no longer distribute and broadcast Mr. Keillor's remaining programs, ""The Writer's Almanac"" and ""The Best of A Prairie Home Companion Hosted by Garrison Keillor.""

It will also change the name of American Public Media's current incarnation of the show, which Chris Thile, a songwriter and mandolinist, took over in October 2016, after Mr. Keillor stepped down. Jon McTaggart, the president of Minnesota Public Radio, said in a statement that ""all of us in the MPR community are saddened by these circumstances."" He added: ""While we appreciate the contributions Garrison has made to M.P.R., and all of public radio, we believe this decision is the right thing to do and is necessary to continue to earn the trust of our audiences, employees and supporters of our public service."" The network did not elaborate on what it called Mr. Keillor's ""inappropriate behavior."" Later on Wednesday, The Star Tribune of Minneapolis published an email from Mr. Keillor in response to a reporter's questions, giving his version of an encounter with an unidentified woman. ""I put my hand on a woman's bare back,"" he wrote. ""I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness and her shirt was open and my hand went up it about six inches. She recoiled. I apologized. I sent her an email of apology later and she replied that she had forgiven me and not to think about it.""

Mr. Keillor claimed that they continued to be friends ""right up until her lawyer called."" He insisted his discomfort with physical affection was common knowledge, adding, ""If I had a dollar for every woman who asked to take a selfie with me and who slipped an arm around me and let it drift down below the beltline, I'd have at least a hundred dollars."" Mr. Keillor is one of many public figures to face consequences after allegations of sexual misconduct in recent weeks. Indeed, just a day earlier, he had come to the defense of his friend and fellow Minnesotan, Senator Al Franken, who is fighting for his political life in the face of accusations of improprieties from four women. In an op-ed for The Washington Post published on Tuesday evening, Mr. Keillor said calls for the senator's resignation were ""pure absurdity"" and dismissed a photograph of the Democrat with his hands on a woman's chest as something ""in a spirit of low comedy.""
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The fallout with the network came as Mr. Keillor was slowly receding from the public stage, though he has still been touring, with appearances around the Northeast this week. On Wednesday, he canceled a performance scheduled that night in Pittsfield, Mass. He originally came up with the idea for his own Americana variety program in 1974 after he traveled to Nashville to write about the Grand Ole Opry for The New Yorker. ""A Prairie Home Companion"" became a radio institution, peaking at 4.1 million weekly listeners a decade before he retired, with lucrative live performances and merchandise that included recordings, books and clothes.

Mr. Keillor sang, performed in skits with recurring characters like Guy Noir and ended each show with a monologue about Lake Wobegon, ""where all the women are strong, all the men are good looking and all the children are above-average."" Famous artists who appeared on his stage included Emmylou Harris, Chet Atkins, Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, Taj Mahal, Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Keb' Mo' and Wilco. He was credited with shaping the early profile of public radio. ""'Prairie Home Companion' came on the scene just as public radio was trying to figure out what its identity was,"" Ira Glass, the host of ""This American Life,"" told The New York Times last year. ""The fact that here was such a visibly weird, funny, idiosyncratic show opened up the space of other weird, idiosyncratic shows, like 'Car Talk,' and our show."" Mr. Keillor, in his statement on Wednesday, which he also published on his website, said he was ""deeply grateful"" for all the years appearing on the radio and touring the country. ""It's some sort of poetic irony to be knocked off the air by a story, having told so many of them myself, but I'm 75 and don't have any interest in arguing about this,"" he said. ""And I cannot in conscience bring danger to a great organization I've worked hard for since 1969."" He also apologized to ""all the poets whose work I won't be reading on the radio and sorry for the people who will lose work on account of this.""","The network says it has severed all business ties with Mr. Keillor, the creator of ""A Prairie Home Companion.""",ffc5888c-af9f-5898-b5db-e838334b487e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/30/business/30xp-Keillor/30xp-Keillor-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=a80952347be8286a7a3779bd429077934b21b74a521984eef77af2a0c3f813a9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Garrison Keillor in 2016.,ffc5888c-af9f-5898-b5db-e838334b487e,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1ffc5888c-af9f-5898-b5db-e838334b487e.jpg,16,11
Automobiles,"Working in Postwar Italy, He Was the da Vinci of the V6",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/automobiles/working-in-postwar-italy-he-was-the-da-vinci-of-the-v6.html,"The question of which engine type is best for powering the cars of the masses may never have a single, unchanging answer. When the V8 prevailed on American roads, it was an appropriate choice for large vehicles in an era of cheap fuel. Times have changed; the workhorse auto engines of our era are those that fit in the narrow engine compartments of the millions of front-wheel-drive cars. For that reason, the V6 has become ubiquitous in full-size family sedans, and in-line 4 cylinders have come to dominate the overall market as vehicles shrink. Many factors have been considered in establishing these norms. The in-line 6, once dominant, is still favored by BMW and others because of its naturally smooth operation, but aside from a handful of exceptions, it is too long to fit under the hood of front-drive models.

In-line 4s that typically power small front-drive cars are attractive to automakers; with fewer parts, they are cheaper to build. But such engines have shortcomings. Their natural imbalance requires the complication of a counterbalancer system to offset vibration, and their less-frequent firing pulses -- two per revolution, or half as many as a V8 -- can generate a driveline vibration felt by passengers under some driving conditions. That makes engines with more cylinders desirable, but they must be contained in a package of short overall length. Today's answer is a V6 engine. These same requirements existed in the late 1930s at Lancia, a small Italian manufacturer. The company needed a smoother, more powerful engine that would fit into an existing, rather narrow engine bay. Lancia had previously solved such problems by building compact engines that arranged the cylinders in a narrow V shape, with both cylinder banks sharing a single cylinder head. Such extreme compactness compromised performance (though Volkswagen was later successful in adopting a similar scheme for its VR6 engine). Something new was needed. Lancia had been founded in 1906 by a racing driver, Vincenzo Lancia. The company made its place by building cars known for exceptional construction and driving qualities, yet priced below the top end of the expanding auto market. (Lancia became part of Fiat in 1969.) The company was a pioneer of unit body construction and 4-wheel independent suspension.

A young engineering graduate, Francesco De Virgilio, was hired at Lancia in 1939 and put to routine tasks. He soon attracted management's attention by improving and simplifying the suspension of a Lancia model. In 1941 he was transferred to the test department, working under Vittorio Jano, one of the outstanding designers of the 20th century. De Virgilio spent the summer of 1943 analyzing the vibration of alternative V-angles for a possible V6 engine. Engine balance been given little attention in the early days of motoring because engine speeds, and therefore shaking forces, were low, but as engines were made smaller and higher-revving, controlling vibration became more important. Today, engineers let their computer workstations pop out solutions to deal with vibration problems. Easy answers of this kind have been a blessing and a curse. They are a blessing because junior engineers no longer need to spend weeks in pencil-and-paper calculation as De Virgilio did. They are a curse because instant computer solutions do not confer the insight that De Virgilio gained. De Virgilio's career is chronicled in a new, generously illustrated book, ""Lancia and De Virgilio at the Center,"" by Geoffrey Goldberg (David Bull Publishing, 2014). The book has the graceful quality and range of an artist's biography, properly treating De Virgilio's entire life as relevant to his work. He is depicted with his family, at work and at the racetrack. (Fangio was a Formula One champion in the Lancia D-50, fielded by Ferrari, in 1956.) There are reproductions of many of his sketches and drawings as well as photos of the hardware he created. De Virgilio showed his superiors that a V6 with its cylinder banks positioned at a 60-degree V angle and a crankshaft with six crankpins -- the section where the connecting rods attach -- spaced at 60-degree intervals could be made uniquely smooth-running. There was official resistance to his conclusion, because, as the automotive historian Karl Ludvigsen has noted, the V6 was a ""virtually unknown engine type in the 1950s."" Even so, Lancia's team built, evaluated and rejected as less smooth alternative designs before accepting De Virgilio's solution. In the end, Jano, Lancia's chief engineer, chose De Virgilio's V6 to power the very influential 1950 Lancia Aurelia. De Virgilio's solution was a crankshaft with four main bearings and six crankpins; his design resulted in evenly spaced firing intervals and a low-vibration power plant. (By contrast, many of the V6s that followed were built like V8s, with pairs of connecting rods bolted side-by-side on each of the three crankpins.)

Offsetting the crankpins, as De Virgilio did, weakened the crankshaft because each pair of crankpins was joined to a disc between them, with almost no overlapping metal between each pair of pins. Like most engineering decisions, this was a compromise; at the engine speeds prevalent in that era, the engines were reliable, and the result was a new kind of smooth, compact automotive power plant. The Aurelia it powered was a streamlined sporting sedan that strongly influenced subsequent European auto design. When, in 1956, Enzo Ferrari wanted a head-start on 1957's new Formula Two racing class, he engaged Jano as a consultant. With the Aurelia's competition success in mind, a six-crankpin V6 to power the Ferrari racecar was drawn up, widening the V angle to 65 degrees to make room for three dual-throat carburetors. Later production V6 auto engines had a less elegant origin -- as utilitarian cost-cutters. Buick built an aluminum V8 during the early 1960s (later used in Land Rovers), but it was expensive. The project manager, Joseph D. Turlay, made a simplifying proposal: Chop off two cylinders to make a shared-crankpin V6 and give it a low-cost iron block. This saved money by allowing V6s to be produced on modified V8 tooling, even though the result was neither ideally balanced (the engines are sometime called paint shakers) nor did it have an even firing interval. These shortcomings were masked by the use of soft engine mounts. Buick's first Fireball V6 arrived in 1962, and a smoother even-fire engine with six separate crankpins came late in 1977. De Virgilio's V6 work was modern in the sense that he was trying to package engine functions to fit external requirements. Automakers in need of a short engine with more than 4 cylinders have made millions of 90-degree V6s, saving money by sharing tooling with V8s. Those compromise V6s were not as smooth as De Virgilio's solution of 1943 -- a configuration now broadly embraced -- but they were effective automobile power plants.","An innovative design by Francesco De Virgilio, introduced more than 60 years ago, is the basis for many modern 6-cylinder engines.",f7af67a1-d43a-5949-a837-1fcc7f8b2a98,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/14/automobiles/14ENGINE3/ENGINE3-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=692&w=600&s=81edea041518474f1f7b5b67e92ca857a8ee3ca1c14645b495eaafa5b5955273&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Francesco De Virgilio in 1990 with his V6.,f7af67a1-d43a-5949-a837-1fcc7f8b2a98,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1f7af67a1-d43a-5949-a837-1fcc7f8b2a98.jpg,23,23

Automobiles,'Rush': The Drama Is Off the Track,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/automobiles/rush-the-drama-is-off-the-track.html,"Hollywood has long tried to make films about auto racing that would strike a chord with general audiences. So far, the commercial successes have been few -- and, with rare exceptions, the racing has served as little more than a noisy background that fed speed and thrills to another story line. ""I mean, there's John Frankenheimer's 'Grand Prix' from 1966, and that's about it,"" Mario Andretti said in a telephone interview, adding that he had seen almost every racing movie made. ""Grand Prix"" won three Academy Awards for technical achievement; an auto racing movie has never won an Oscar for Best Picture. ""I'm sorry, that's it,"" Andretti said, offering a critique informed by the many championships to his credit. But that bleak assessment could change. Andretti said he had hope for the prospects of the new Ron Howard film, ""Rush,"" which chronicles the 1976 Formula One season and the duel between Niki Lauda and James Hunt for that year's driver championship. The movie opens nationwide on Sept. 27.

""It was probably a good choice for subject matter on the part of the filmmakers,"" said Andretti, whose opinion carries extra weight because he raced, and won, against both men. Moreover, he won the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix, the climax of both the racing season and the movie. It was a season full of dramatic twists. Lauda had won five races when the circuit came to the Nurburgring for the German Grand Prix, where his Ferrari spun into a guardrail and caught fire. His helmet came off, and he suffered extensive burns. Though Lauda missed two races while he was hospitalized, he still led Hunt in World Championship points when, despite his painful injuries, he returned to competition just six weeks after the near-fatal crash. Pulling a helmet down over his burns was every bit as excruciating as depicted in the movie, Lauda said at the London premiere on Sept. 2. He said the movie was so realistic that it helped him to recall forgotten details of the crash. ""Although I never lost consciousness, I never realized what my rescuers were doing to try to keep me alive,"" he said. ""I was only concerned with my own survival.""

Although the battle for the championship was compelling in its own right, where the film has received the most praise is in the script and the highly charged chemistry between the actors who play the main characters -- Daniel Bruhl as the dour Lauda and Chris Hemsworth as the flamboyant Hunt. ""Most modern-era car racing movies, from 'Grand Prix' and 'Le Mans' to 'Days of Thunder', have been far stronger at portraying the excitement on the track than at developing interesting downtime drama among the characters,"" wrote Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter, noting that the reverse is true with ""Rush,"" which devotes far more time to exploring the personalities of the drivers. ""Mozart vs. Salieri. Kennedy vs. Khrushchev. Gates vs. Jobs,"" Variety's film critic, Peter Debruge, wrote, adding that ""Rush"" is ""not just one of the great racing movies of all time, but a virtuoso feat of filmmaking in its own right, elevated by two of the year's most compelling performances. It's high-octane entertainment that demands to be seen on the big screen, assembled for grown-ups and executed in such a way as to enthrall even those who've never watched a race in their life."" Closer to the sport, the retired Formula One driver David Coulthard said he found the racing scenes credible, although ""no film can quite capture what really goes on inside the car."" ""But I thought the characters were compelling and believable,"" Coulthard said in an interview at the Italian Grand Prix last week. ""I have a rather personal perspective on the two men, as I know Niki, of course, from my association with Mercedes, and I met James when I was a very young driver."" The fast-living Hunt died of a heart attack in 1993 at age 45. One of the few tempered comments about the movie or its performances came from Bernie Ecclestone, who controls the commercial rights to Formula One. At the Italian Grand Prix, Mr. Ecclestone said that no one could ever play Hunt like Hunt himself: ""He would have livened the film up a lot.""","Ron Howard's film, which chronicles the duel between Niki Lauda and James Hunt for the 1976 Formula One driver championship, has racing greats fired up.",0b5c86ae-81bd-5f9b-854a-d5a9b3c231f2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/15/automobiles/Rush/Rush-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=248&w=600&s=d600fe7a8133df23b0a1a310e65171dd2eea3be267f06deb16621d4544ca4fc1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"MOODY  On-track clashes play a role, but it's the driver personalities that distinguish ""Rush"" from other racing films.",0b5c86ae-81bd-5f9b-854a-d5a9b3c231f2,Demo_data/D1_imgs/10b5c86ae-81bd-5f9b-854a-d5a9b3c231f2.jpg,23,23
Opinion,Who Bears Witness to a Hidden Epidemic?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/opinion/sunday/domestic-violence-coronavirus.html,"We know domestic violence is spiking under lockdown -- we just don't know the details. Here are women who do.

Within the first few weeks of states' going into lockdown, reports began flooding in from domestic violence hotline centers throughout the country: They were seeing spikes in calls. But as sheltering-in-place dragged on, the calls for help dropped off. To those familiar with the dynamics of intimate-partner violence, this was not a good thing.

That domestic violence is part of the story of this pandemic is well known: Lockdowns have made it more difficult for domestic violence survivors to distance themselves from their abusers; orders of protection often take longer to come through because courts aren't operating at full capacity; experts have viewed the decline in calls for help with alarm, as it suggests survivors might not be able to get away from abusers long enough to reach out.

But if covering domestic violence, which takes place mainly behind closed doors, is difficult in normal times, telling the story of its rise during a time of lockdowns and quarantines poses an even bigger challenge. That is why Christopher Lee, a photographer, opted to focus on the hotline workers. He began photographing them in the Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston metro areas in May. According to Dr. Noel Busch-Armendariz, director of the Institute on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault at the University of Texas at Austin, 38 percent of adult women in Texas in 2011 reported having been in an abusive relationship. The stay-at-home orders have had a severe effect on the most vulnerable women, and domestic violence centers are bracing themselves for the worst. In Texas, which reported record numbers of daily cases of Covid-19 four times last week, the governor signaled on Friday the possibility of a new economic ""lockdown"" if the state cannot curtail its outbreak.

Like so many people around the globe, those who answer phones for domestic violence hotlines are working from home during the coronavirus pandemic. With the benefit of technology, advocates and counselors have been fielding calls, texts and emails from survivors from their kitchen tables and living rooms. Their experiences on one end of these calls help shed light on stories going untold.

Veronica Hernandez, a hotline operator and advocate at SAFE Austin, says she's seen an uptick in reports from a wider array of survivors than usual: men who've been abused, youth who've been trafficked and people who've been hurt by nonromantic partners such as roommates. She's also sensed that those who call have grown more desperate -- she hears more frequently from women who are actively fleeing danger or have already had violent interactions with their abuser. Before the pandemic, callers would be more likely to say they had experienced non-life-threatening behavior or abuse, such as emotional or psychological abuse or behavior that could evolve into something violent. Now they are getting calls that go from zero to 60 in an instant.

As the stories have grown more desperate, the work has grown more challenging. Hotline workers who once counted on the commute between office and home to decompress from stressful professional lives no longer have that sense of separation. ""Bystander trauma is real,"" said Milisa Alexis-Flores, the managing attorney for the Houston office of Aid to Victims of Domestic Abuse, a nonprofit that provides legal aid to domestic violence survivors. ""We all experience it doing this line of work when you consume other people's trauma for a living. That's just the nature of the job and it's always challenging, but it's more challenging in a different way when you're doing it at home.""

But ""I at least am still able to try to decompress in the safety of my home, which my client cannot do,"" Ms. Alexis-Flores said. These images don't quite shed light on the domestic violence that is currently on the rise in private spaces around the world. What they do highlight is the parallel world of the hotline operators, working from their homes, speaking over the phone to survivors calling from rooms that at first glance probably look very similar; what sets them apart is the danger.",We know domestic violence is spiking under lockdown — we just don't know the details.

Technology,"In U.S.-China Tech Feud, Taiwan Feels Heat From Both Sides",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/technology/taiwan-china-tsmc-huawei.html,"TAINAN, Taiwan -- The United States and China are wrestling to lead the world in artificial intelligence, 5G wireless and other cutting-edge technologies. But the real wizardry that makes those advancements possible is being performed on a yam-shaped island that sits between them, geographically and politically. On Taiwan's southern rim, inside an arena-size facility stretched out among lush greenery and coconut palms, colossal machines are manipulating matter at unimaginably tiny scale. A powerful laser vaporizes droplets of molten tin, causing them to emit ultraviolet light. Mirrors focus the light into a beam, which draws features into a silicon wafer with the precision, as one researcher put it, ""equivalent to shooting an arrow from Earth to hit an apple placed on the moon."" The high-performance computer chips that emerge from this process go into the brains of the latest tech products from both sides of the Pacific. Or at least they did until last month, when the Trump administration effectively forced leading chip makers in Taiwan -- and elsewhere -- to stop taking orders from China's proudest tech champion, the 5G giant Huawei. The administration's stranglehold on Huawei shows that for all of China's economic progress, the United States still has final say over the technologies without which the modern world could not run. Chip making relies on American tools and know-how, which gives officials in Washington the power of life and death over semiconductor buyers and suppliers anywhere on the planet.

Next in the firing line is China's most advanced chip producer, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation. The U.S. Department of Commerce told American companies last week that they needed permission to export to SMIC, saying its chips could be used by China's military. If the administration blocks SMIC from using American software and equipment entirely, it will sharply set back Beijing's hopes for meeting more of its own semiconductor needs. That leaves Taiwanese chip companies -- including the industry's leading light, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which owns the Tainan plant -- in a tough spot.

They are forced to heed the dictates of American tech policy. Yet they can scarcely ignore the fact that so many of their customers and their customers' customers are in China, where the Communist government is also threatening Taiwan with ever bolder displays of military force. China has for decades claimed the self-governing democracy as part of its territory. In the high-stakes tech fight, TSMC had been playing Finland: a sometime friend to both feuding giants. But that is not the way the tech world works anymore.

""China has virtually no room for maneuver,"" said Pierre Ferragu, the head of technology research at New Street Research. ""The U.S. definitely has the upper hand in the struggle."" Tensions in the Taiwan Strait are rising more broadly this year. The Trump administration has stepped up official exchanges with Taiwan ever since its president, Tsai Ing-wen, won re-election in January over an opponent who was friendlier to Beijing. In response, Chinese aircraft and warships have menaced the island with growing frequency. When a State Department representative, Keith Krach, visited Taiwan recently, Ms. Tsai feted him at a banquet alongside a bevy of government dignitaries and TSMC's retired founder, Morris Chang, a nod to the company's significance to Taiwan's relations with the United States. American officials have taken a great interest in TSMC, whose advanced chips are used in fighter jets and other hardware critical to America's military edge. The company said this year that it would build a new factory in Arizona, responding to American concerns about overreliance on offshore production. Now, the Trump administration's campaign against Huawei has forced TSMC to turn against one of its biggest customers. With the two companies unable to work together without licenses, Huawei may find itself unable to make its late-model handsets, an important chunk of its business, once it uses up its chip inventory. ""I don't think Huawei has much of a future unless they can find some way to get their suppliers to get export licenses,"" said Matt Bryson, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. One of Huawei's deputy chairmen, Guo Ping, said last week that the company was assessing its options.

""Survival is our main goal,"" Mr. Guo said in Shanghai. ""As Alexandre Dumas once said, all of human wisdom is summed up in two words: wait and hope."" TSMC executives sound confident that Huawei's plight will not dent it much. If Huawei cannot order chips from the company, then its rivals will instead. Mark Liu, TSMC's chairman, said at an industry conference last week that Taiwan would continue improving its technology so American and Chinese companies had no choice but to keep working with the island. ""We are enjoying the success of the past,"" Mr. Liu said. But for the future, ""we cannot stay where we used to be before."" TSMC could still get caught in the middle, though, if the U.S. government's continuing attacks prompt Beijing to strike back. A full-blown clampdown on sales to SMIC could increase the risk of Chinese retaliation ""really significantly,"" said Mr. Ferragu of New Street Research. Countermeasures that Beijing might once have considered too self-defeating -- such as choking off Qualcomm's or Apple's sales in China, effectively depriving Chinese citizens of most high-end smartphones -- could start to seem more acceptable.

For Taiwan, these are not just business questions. China's reliance on TSMC's chips has long made people on the island see the company as a bulwark against Chinese military aggression. At its shareholder meeting this summer, an investor, Huang Hsueh-fen, approached the microphone hugging a giant bouquet. ""No matter how serious the pandemic becomes, I must still come offer flowers to the company that is our sacred mountain, protector of the nation,"" Ms. Huang said. Tech workers in Taiwan have a Mandarin rhyme about the young engineers who put in late nights and sacrifice their health for the company: ""A hundred thousand youths, a hundred thousand livers, shift by shift TSMC is saving Taiwan."" So what happens if China stops needing TSMC as much as it does now? This could happen naturally. TSMC is working at the frontiers of physics to continue doubling the number of transistors it can fit onto a piece of silicon. That principle, known as Moore's Law, has guided semiconductor development for decades. Not all tech products today need the most advanced chips, though. Some work best by packaging high-end processors with less sophisticated ones. Simple ""internet of things"" devices do just fine with simpler chips. ""The way we design chips is changing. It just has to,"" said Jay Goldberg, a tech industry consultant and former Qualcomm executive. ""Moore's Law is slowing, and we're just having to design chips in a way to accommodate that.""

China is trying to poach more Taiwanese talent for the task. Dozens of former TSMC managers and engineers joined two ambitious Chinese chip projects last year, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Ms. Kao of TSMC said recent turnover was less than 5 percent, which the company considered a healthy level. Lin Chih-chieh, a law professor at National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu, Taiwan, said the island needed stronger laws to keep Taiwanese chip makers' trade secrets from being spirited away to China. Still, Ms. Lin said, Taiwan's chip strengths prevent China from subjugating the island as quickly as it did Hong Kong, where the government has curbed civil liberties.",The island's biggest chip maker has been a coveted partner to both battling giants. But rising nationalism is making it harder to keep the middle ground.,9b15aa80-ee3b-5f5a-9055-a94d36196d85,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/28/business/00taiwan-chips-1/00taiwan-chips-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=526b0db5bd418cad33c49e9afc27850636728264763b06f5c62d051d5bb8bf21&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"People in Taiwan have a rhyme about TSMC's workers: Shift by shift, they are saving Taiwan.",9b15aa80-ee3b-5f5a-9055-a94d36196d85,Demo_data/D1_imgs/19b15aa80-ee3b-5f5a-9055-a94d36196d85.jpg,20,20
Movies,"Stuart Gordon, Whose Films Reanimated Horror, Dies at 72",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/movies/stuart-gordon-dies.html,"Stuart Gordon, a director best known for lavishly lurid horror films with a piercing sense of humor, notably the cult favorite ""Re-Animator,"" died on Tuesday in Van Nuys, Calif. He was 72. His wife, Carolyn Purdy-Gordon, an actress who appeared in many of his films and with whom he founded the Chicago-based Organic Theater Company, said the cause was multiple organ failure brought on by kidney disease. Mr. Gordon's generally low-budget films often combined the body horror of John Carpenter or David Cronenberg's films with the titillation found in Roger Corman's. He said that surprising moviegoers was an important part of his work, and he did his best to exceed the everyday terrors of many slasher movies. ""There is a side of me that likes to break through cliches and wake people up,"" Mr. Gordon told Rolling Stone in 1986.

Before turning to film, he directed experimental plays at the Organic Theater Company in the late 1960s. The company produced original works, like the comic-book-themed trilogy ""Warp,"" one-third of which briefly made it to Broadway in 1973; it also staged the first production of David Mamet's breakout play, ""Sexual Perversity in Chicago,"" in 1974. ""Re-Animator"" (1985), Mr. Gordon's first feature film, was based on a serialized story about human revivification by H.P. Lovecraft. He wrote the adaptation with Dennis Paoli and William Norris. The movie centers on Herbert West, a medical student played by Jeffrey Combs (he would become a stock player of sorts for Mr. Gordon) who discovers a chemical reagent that returns dead bodies to life. His experiments with it yield ever more grotesque results, culminating in a gang of marauding undead. One unforgettable scene involves the severed head of a reanimated corpse and a captive young woman.

""'Re-Animator' has as much originality as it has gore, and that's really saying something,"" Janet Maslin wrote in her review in The New York Times when the movie opened in New York theaters. The film, she added, ""has a fast pace and a good deal of grisly vitality"" and even ""a sense of humor, albeit one that would be lost on 99.9 percent of any ordinary moviegoing crowd.""

Mr. Paoli, who also worked with Mr. Gordon on later Lovecraft adaptations, said in a telephone interview that the humor-horror hybrid in ""Re-Animator"" and other Gordon films was similar to that in his theater work, which often straddled the line between the serious and the hilarious. ""If you watch someone laughing and you don't hear them, it looks like they're screaming,"" Mr. Paoli said. ""The fact is they're both releases of tension, and Stuart was a genius at storing up that tension and then releasing it over the line in one direction or another."" That same combination of mordant comedy, graphic violence and cosmic horror turned up in Lovecraft derivations like ""From Beyond"" (1986), about a doctor who uses a device to see into alien dimensions and whose pineal gland bursts through his forehead; and ""Dagon"" (2001), about a village of human-fish hybrids who enjoy procreating with people and sometimes skinning them. Not all Mr. Gordon's films were creature features. He, Brian Yuzna and Ed Naha came up with the story for the hit Disney film ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" (1989), and he was an executive producer of the sequel, ""Honey, I Blew Up the Kid"" (1992).

He also made science fiction films, like ""Fortress"" (1992), about a high-tech prison in a dystopian future; and nightmarish dramas, like ""Stuck"" (2007), about a woman who crashes into a homeless man with her car while intoxicated, then drives home with him trapped in her windshield and barely alive. Mr. Gordon adapted the work of other authors, like Edgar Allan Poe (""The Pit and the Pendulum,"" 1991) and Ray Bradbury (""The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit,"" 1998). He returned to the work of Mr. Mamet with the film version of his one-act play ""Edmond"" (2005), about a man, played by William H. Macy, who renounces his strait-laced life and goes on a wild tear that ends with murder and a long prison sentence. To Mr. Gordon, the goal of supposedly highbrow theater was not much different from that of a blood-soaked horror film. ""I have never separated art from having a good time,"" he said in 1986. Stuart Alan Gordon was born in Chicago on Aug. 11, 1947, to Bernard and Rosalie (Sabath) Gordon. His father was a supervisor at a cosmetics factory, his mother a high school English teacher. He graduated from high school in Chicago before studying theater at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. At the university Mr. Gordon formed Screw Theater, an experimental troupe that incensed the college authorities with a 1968 production of ""Peter Pan"" that featured a nude dance sequence. Mr. Gordon and Ms. Purdy, who was in the show, were arrested after the second performance, and the university demanded that Mr. Gordon submit future scripts in advance and allow faculty members into every rehearsal. Mr. Gordon declined and left the university.","His low-budget movies, notably the cult favorite ""Re-Animator,"" combined grisly body horror with a mordant sense of humor.",e2049485-82ff-5197-bc70-4be4f63d1be2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/29/obituaries/29gordon-obit1/24gordon-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c9e89045491df6b2332318b7530b799797b6d250ac7d3de195d57db9ae16028c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The director Stuart Gordon in 2008.

Travel,TripAdvisor to Stop Selling Tickets to Many Animal Attractions,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/travel/tripadvisor-to-stop-selling-tickets-to-many-animal-attractions.html,"TripAdvisor, one of the world's largest travel websites, and its booking service, Viator, will no longer sell tickets to hundreds of attractions where travelers come into contact with wild animals or endangered species held in captivity, the company announced Tuesday. The attractions include elephant rides, swimming-with-dolphin experiences and the petting of endangered species like tigers. The decision, the first of its kind by a leading travel booking site, came after roughly six months of research and consultation with animal groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), Association of Zoos and Aquariums (A.Z.A.), Global Wildlife Conservation (G.W.C.) and others. ""TripAdvisor is a leader in the industry and we understand and applaud that this is a precedent-setting move,"" a corporate liaison for PETA, Stephanie Shaw, said. PETA and other animal welfare groups say dolphins and elephants held in captivity for entertainment purposes can suffer severe physical and psychological damage.

TripAdvisor also announced the creation of a wildlife tourism education portal, in partnership with leading animal protection organizations, that will inform the site's users who review attractions and general visitors about animal welfare issues. ""We believe the end result of our efforts will be enabling travelers to make more thoughtful choices about whether to visit an animal attraction and to write more meaningful reviews about those attractions,"" TripAdvisor's chief executive and co-founder, Stephen Kaufer, said in a statement. All animal attractions, even those that will no longer be bookable, will remain on the site in the review section, as long as they follow standard listing procedures, but will be marked with a ""PAW"" icon that will link to the education portal with ""numerous points of view"" relevant to the animals involved from a variety of organizations, TripAdvisor said. TripAdvisor will stop selling tickets to some attractions immediately, but the totality of the booking policy changes, as well as the educational portal, will not be completely implemented until early 2017. There will also be an appeals process for the hundreds of affected attractions should they be able to prove they are within the new policy, the company said. Last October, Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, which will be working with TripAdvisor on its education initiative, released a comprehensive study on wildlife tourism. Among its many findings was that between two million and four million tourists per year pay to visit attractions that are considered harmful to animal welfare, and that a large majority of TripAdvisor reviews for such attractions failed to mention animal welfare concerns.

""I think the average person would think that there's animals there, there's gotta be laws and regulations behind what's happening, but that's not the case, even in places like the U.S.,"" Wes Sechrest, the chief scientist and chief executive of the conservation group G.W.C., said. The entire initiative began several months ago after animal groups and users in the TripAdvisor community expressed concerns, the company said. In April, the World Animal Protection (W.A.P.) agency singled out TripAdvisor in its ""Wildlife, not entertainers"" campaign, asking for signatures on a petition calling for the types of changes that the company is now promising to implement. W.A.P. will now be partnering with TripAdvisor on its educational initiative. While most of the animal groups involved in this effort echoed PETA's overall approval of the new policies, not all groups had every concern addressed. ""There are some areas that I think every one of these groups we spoke with would agree on, and there are some that are not universally agreed upon,"" TripAdvisor's chief marketing officer, Barbara Messing, said. ""We just had to, at the end of the day, come to our own conclusions internally about what makes sense for us and what we thought reflected the totality of what we learned from the groups."" PETA opposes all activities where animals are kept in captivity for profit, including those at zoos and aquariums, but these attractions will remain bookable. However, add-on attractions that are not in compliance with the new policy will not, TripAdvisor said. TripAdvisor's new policy also includes many exemptions, like feeding programs where visitors are under the supervision of zoo or wildlife officials, such as giraffe feeding at the San Diego Zoo, children's petting zoos with domestic animals and voluntourism programs like the ones at the Elephant Nature Park in Thailand, where contact with elephants is likely for visiting volunteers.

Animal welfare groups are hoping these changes create a ripple effect throughout the travel booking industry. ""TripAdvisor's competitors and others within the travel industry will take note of this, and we hope and expect that many other companies will follow,"" Ms. Shaw of PETA said. TripAdvisor, and its competitors like Expedia, already do not allow bookings that involve killing or injuring captive animals for blood sport, but TripAdvisor is the first travel booking site of its size and influence -- the company reaches 350 million unique visitors per month -- to limit access to attractions featuring more commonly practiced tourist-animal engagement. ""We do think it's an important issue, and we want to be part of the solution,"" Sarah Gavin, vice president of global communications at Expedia, said of animal welfare and the travel booking industry.

Casting Murray is a surefire way to win over an audience. It also means yielding at least part of the movie to him, which is what happens here. He plays a bigger-than-life sybarite whose daughter enlists him to help with her marital woes. If that sounds like a dubious idea for a grown child, it's also a playful conceptual gambit for a director whose father, Francis Ford Coppola, casts his own long shadow.

Murray plays Felix, a retired gallerist and full-time bon vivant who's done ostentatiously well for himself, with a vintage Alfa Romeo in the garage and an Ellsworth Kelly on the mantel. His daughter Laura (Rashida Jones, yet another child of a legendary father) is a writer who's struggling to put words on paper while caring for her two young girls. Her husband, Dean (Marlon Wayans), always seems to be perfunctorily kissing Laura hello or goodbye on his way out the door (to run his generic start-up), leaving her in the soft domestic chaos that envelops her. She may be the heroine of this story, but she isn't the center of her universe.

The plot hinges on Laura's not-unreasonable fear that Dean is no longer interested in her and may be having an affair. All the familiar signs seem to be there, including his business trips and long work hours that often find Laura home with the children. Coppola sketches in Laura's world and its loneliness (ripe terrain for dark thoughts) early and starkly when Dean abruptly pulls away from her embrace one night. The next morning, as Laura tends to the kids, and Dean hurries to leave for work, they move around their kitchen with well-rehearsed choreography. The domestic cacophony may be reassuring, but the coarsening of intimacy is palpable.

Coppola's minimalism can be frustratingly rather than productively diffuse, but her aesthetic reserve suits this story and the diffidence of her heroine. Laura is appealing -- or rather Jones is -- and you're drawn to her just by virtue of her being the lead. Even so it's instructive that the first voice you hear in the movie is Felix's. ""And remember, don't give your heart to any boys,"" he says in voice-over, right after the American Zoetrope credit appears and before the first image materializes. ""You're mine until you get married,"" Felix continues, ""then you're still mine."" A girlish voice laughs and adds an incredulous ""OK, Dad."" And then Chet Baker starts singing.","In Sofia Coppola's latest, Rashida Jones plays a woman worried about her marriage. Who's she gonna call? Bill Murray, a.k.a.

Fashion & Style,Internet Porn Nearly Ruined His Life. Now He Wants to Help.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/fashion/mens-style/anti-internet-porn-addict.html,"Internet Porn Nearly Ruined His Life. Now He Wants to Help.

Alexander Rhodes sat along a stretch of grass, looking out over the Allegheny River. The two of us were sitting in a quiet space on the outskirts of Pittsburgh where we had planned to spend the night in tents camping out. ""The key thing to consider is that I am not a very good businessman,"" he said. ""I'm not really anything but a guy who was addicted to internet porn."" A few years ago, Mr. Rhodes, 26, founded a website as an online space meant to help others who share his particular problem. It has about one million unique visitors each month, he said, and nearly breaks even. Mr. Rhodes, who grew up in western Pennsylvania and worked at Google until recently, is now hoping to make his site into something larger. With the help of his father and other family members, he is transforming part of an abandoned church into a base of operations for his fledgling company.

""It's one thing to look back and regret what happened in terms of growing up, being addicted to internet porn,"" he said. ""You might look back and be like: 'Oh, man. I was a loser. And if I never watched it, my life would be so much better.' And maybe that's true. But at the same time, the fact that I was addicted to internet porn, the fact that I was so mediocre, makes me uniquely qualified to help humanity."" In recent years, Mr. Rhodes has emerged as a spokesman against a ""disease"" that hasn't been officially recognized by the medical establishment. He seemed uneasy with his new status. He was careful with every word and asked to go off the record more than a government official. He would not confirm whether he was involved with someone, saying only that, since giving up pornography ""for good"" in 2013, he has been able to have meaningful relationships with women. In some ways, his story is that of the digital age. His father was a computer programmer, and he was exposed to digital technology from early on. He gravitated to Nintendo Game Boy and eventually moved to the Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation. At 11 or so, he said, he clicked on a banner ad by mistake and found an image depicting rape. By the time he had reached adolescence, so had the internet, and Mr. Rhodes came to rely on high-definition pornography that was easy to find and often free. By college, he was masturbating while watching it up to 14 times a day, he said.

Mr. Rhodes's seeming dependence on porn didn't help matters with his first girlfriend, whom he started dating when he was a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh. It was his first real chance for sustained intimacy, and he blew it. ""I don't think it was all due to internet porn,"" he said. ""But I can tell you that the sex life didn't go very well. I had porn-induced erectile dysfunction -- a very mild form, and this is all very self-diagnosed, because doctors won't diagnose this -- but I was able to maintain an erection by fantasizing about pornography. That was the only way."" In 2011, Mr. Rhodes was lost and in search of support. He created a discussion forum on Reddit on the topic of abstaining from masturbation and pornography. He realized he was far from alone and began his stand-alone site soon after. After college, he continued to build the site while working as a contractor for Google, specializing in data analysis. He said he earned good money and was able to put a good amount into the website (called NoFap.com, from a slang term for masturbation). But he was still using the supposed vice he was railing against. It took another failed relationship to get him to quit.

""I think I was relying on pornography as some kind of emotional crutch,"" he said. ""If anything bad would happen, you would go to porn, because it would always be there. ""I knew it was bad for me,"" he said. ""But I also realized it was bad for women I was involved with, and that was the moment that I said: 'I need to leave this thing behind. It is completely distorting my sexuality to the point where it could actually be harmful or at least not enjoyable for other people who I am involved with.'"" Mr. Rhodes came to believe he had a calling greater than his work in data analysis at Google. ""It wasn't an easy decision,"" he said of his leaving the job last year. ""But ultimately it was what was best for humanity."" The website serves as an online umbrella for men looking to escape pornography. It has advertisements for porn-blocking software and online programs that promote the idea of steering clear of pornography and masturbation. The site also has discussion forums and includes testimonials by men sharing stories of their successes and failures. And it helps match men with ""accountability partners"" meant to serve as Alcoholics Anonymous-style sponsors, to keep a person on the right path. The site generates revenue through subscriptions and advertising, Mr. Rhodes said. To make it into something more robust, Mr. Rhodes needed to ""come out"" as a spokesman of sorts. After he appeared in a New York magazine article in 2013 about men who had quit masturbating, he told his mother what was going on, much to her horror. Other interviews followed.

While his family remains supportive, there are limits. When he showed his mother a recent article in Time magazine in which he was quoted, she said, joking, ""I shouldn't be reading these types of things about my son,"" Mr. Rhodes said, recalling his mother's reaction. On the first day I visited Mr. Rhodes, we climbed the stairs of the former St. Clement Church in Tarentum, Pa. The structure, built in 1906, had long since been abandoned, its pews, confessional and attached school crumbling and gathering dust. His father, Phillip Rhodes, had recently bought the sprawling complex at auction for $50,000. While the church is likely to house other businesses, the younger Mr. Rhodes sees a future there for him and a fully staffed operation. He sat on one side of the church confessional while I sat on the other. ""Tell me the last time you watched porn,"" I said, joking. Despite the location, he has largely kept away from religious people, especially evangelicals wanting to team up with him, even though such a relationship could help fund his work.

""I have viewpoints that don't mesh with their viewpoints,"" Mr. Rhodes said. ""I'm very sex-positive. I'm not a religious person. I'm not someone who supports religion. I'm not against religion, but I don't support it. And I completely, firmly believe in premarital sex."" Mr. Rhodes said he has also endured the wrath of those on the other end of the ideological spectrum. People have tried -- and failed -- to hack the site's servers, and its forums have been bombarded with pornographic images, he said. His father received pornography in the mail, Mr. Rhodes said, and he himself has gotten death threats. ""It's just something you have to deal with and let the proper authorities follow up on anything,"" he said. Soon it would grow terribly cold, making for a terrible night of sleep in spite of a tent and a supposedly insulated sleeping bag that I bought at a suburban Target. On the morning of our second day, Mr. Rhodes sat near the extinguished campfire from the night before, laptop on his knees. Soon we'd be departing the campsite, heading back to the city, to ""civilization."" But first he had to present a webinar for another pornography-addiction outfit. During the chat, he spoke with people who asked about avoiding triggers. As the session continued, he spoke less about pornography than about the need to take care of oneself, both physically and emotionally. He talked about developing good habits and routines, about changing one's life in general. When a health care worker asked about fatigue and how he believed it often led him to pornography, Mr. Rhodes told the man that he needed to take care of his own health as well. ""It's like if you're on an airplane flight,"" Mr. Rhodes said, ""and they say, 'Oh, you have to put your oxygen mask on before assisting others with theirs.' It's because you'll pass out trying to get a mask on to somebody else. You have to make sure you're in a balanced spot in order to best serve other people, in order to best serve the world.""","Alexander Rhodes, the founder of an anti-porn website, sets up shop in an abandoned church.",19068ee7-c56f-5613-b3a5-c4f7c64b729b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/08/fashion/08-Male-Animal-1/08-Male-Animal-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=ff37c0515a1d577366046a842fbf27e2400474024196b08b6e25aef8dae9df6e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Alexander Rhodes, the founder of a pornography recovery website, said giving up porn has allowed him to have meaningful relationships.",19068ee7-c56f-5613-b3a5-c4f7c64b729b,Demo_data/D1_imgs/119068ee7-c56f-5613-b3a5-c4f7c64b729b.jpg,19,20
Theater,"Broadway Sets Box-Office Record, Powered by 'Hamilton' and Springsteen",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/theater/broadway-sets-box-office-record.html,"A rapping Hamilton and a (quietly) rocking Boss propelled Broadway's box office to new heights over the past year, as rising demand and even faster-rising ticket prices shattered industry records. Over all, the 67 shows that ran over the last season brought in $1.7 billion from 13.8 million patrons, according to figures released Tuesday by the Broadway League. ""We've never had as many big hits,"" said Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the League, which represents producers and presenters. Broadway has been on an upswing for five years, powered by a surge in New York City tourism and a resurgence in enthusiasm for musical theater. Even so, the theater season that ended Sunday was remarkably lucrative, as producers have become more sophisticated -- and more aggressive -- about pricing.

The new pacesetter, ""Hamilton,"" benefiting from the first full season in which it regularly charged $849 for the best seats at the Richard Rodgers Theater, grossed $161 million in New York. The musical, about the life and death of the founding father Alexander Hamilton, grossed more than five other musicals that sold more tickets but charged lower prices, including ""Wicked,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King."" At the same time, Bruce Springsteen, who can sell out arenas or stadiums, delivered a dramatic lesson on the economic value of scarcity, fetching a jaw-dropping $503 average ticket price for his ""Springsteen on Broadway,"" a blend of stripped-down songs and ruminative storytelling that he has been performing since October in the 948-seat Walter Kerr Theater. By contrast the average Broadway ticket was $123, and even at ""Hamilton"" it was only $282. [Sign up for Theater Update, a weekly email of news and features.] Because of a quirk in the way the trade association tracks data, this past season consisted of 53 weeks, making season-to-season comparisons imperfect, but for the first 52 weeks grosses were up an eye-popping 14.4 percent. Attendance crept up a far more modest 1.6 percent.

Dynamic pricing -- the practice of varying prices to reflect consumer demand -- is not new to Broadway. But this past season, producers became increasingly deft at it, and that's why revenue is growing so much faster than attendance. Theatergoers generally pay a premium for a seat in the center orchestra. It often costs less to see shows on a Tuesday night than on a Saturday, and more during the last week of December (Christmas!) than the first week of January (cold!). The three shows with the highest average prices this past season -- ""Hamilton,"" ""Springsteen"" and ""Dear Evan Hansen"" -- are all in midsize theaters, meaning they had a limited supply of tickets despite enormous demand. And the premiums they charged had an added benefit for producers -- helping reduce profiteering by resellers, and reclaiming money for investors and artists. ""Dynamic pricing is a reality today, not just in our industry, but in many,"" said Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization, which operates nine Broadway theaters. ""There are many, many, many inexpensive tickets on Broadway, but there is no reason a Springsteen ticket or a 'Hamilton' ticket should be less than it is, from a supply and demand standpoint, because the price is reasonably matching what the consumer considers to be the value."" The most striking example this past season: The producers of ""Hello, Dolly!,"" recognizing the intense enthusiasm for Bette Midler's performance in the lead role, charged $998 for front row seats late last year, counting on her biggest fans to pay for the pleasure of proximity.

The top-grossing musicals were ""Hamilton"" ($161 million), ""The Lion King"" ($113 million), ""Wicked"" ($96 million), ""Hello, Dolly!"" ($91 million) and ""Dear Evan Hansen"" ($88 million). None of the season's new musicals opened early enough to outgross those longer-running hits, but some are off to a strong start, particularly ""Frozen"" and ""Mean Girls."" Plays generally gross much less than musicals because they tend to have shorter runs. Just 11 percent of the season's grosses went to plays; top-grossing among them was ""The Play That Goes Wrong,"" a British farce that was the only play to run all 53 weeks of the season, bringing in $19 million.

There has been much hand-wringing -- with good reason -- about the plight of plays on Broadway, where audiences tend to favor musicals. But this past season saw some remarkable signs of financial strength for plays with familiar titles, big stars or strong buzz. ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,"" a two-part drama that is a sequel to the enormously popular novels, is shaping up to be one of the top-grossing plays in Broadway history, bringing in $18 million in its first 10 weeks. And four play revivals have recently been selling strongly -- more strongly than many musicals: ""The Iceman Cometh,"" starring Denzel Washington; ""The Boys in the Band,"" starring Jim Parsons and Zachary Quinto; ""Angels in America,"" starring Andrew Garfield and Nathan Lane; and ""Three Tall Women,"" starring Glenda Jackson and Laurie Metcalf.","The theater season that just ended was remarkably lucrative as producers have become more sophisticated, and more aggressive, about setting prices.",5438ae8c-ee5c-5c1c-9641-2c423a3b9604,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/31/arts/31season/31season-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=2c87fc6de38517ea44cec647f4ad32ab3d1e75dc534401ca7b5ee85a97434401&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,What should we see?

Art & Design,Christo to Build Floating Structure in London's Hyde Park,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/arts/design/christo-london-hyde-park.html,"Christo has long been interested in mastabas, trapezoidal structures that originated in Mesopotamia. He designed a Texas mastaba in 1975, for example, and is devising plans to build a permanent one in Abu Dhabi, which he says will be the largest art structure in the world. But before then, he will build one this summer in Hyde Park in London that will be made up of 7,506 oil barrels and float on the Serpentine lake, behind Kensington Palace.

The temporary structure will be unveiled around June 20, in conjunction with an exhibit at the nearby Serpentine Galleries on Christo and his wife and artistic partner, Jeanne-Claude, who died in 2009. Standing about 65 feet tall and weighing 500 tons, the mastaba will be anchored to one spot but will still bob up and down. The Westminster Council approved the proposal last week.

""The exciting part of the project is that it's detached from the urban landscape,"" Christo said in an interview on Sunday. ""You have this incredible vegetation and open area.""

The mastaba will use 50 times fewer barrels than the planned Abu Dhabi version; while that one will primarily be orange, the British mastaba will take on the colors of its country's flag -- blue, red and white -- as well as purple.

Science,"With Piranha-Like Teeth, This Prehistoric Predator Never Bit Off More Than It Could Chew",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/science/piranha-fossil.html,"With Piranha-Like Teeth, This Prehistoric Predator Never Bit Off More Than It Could Chew 
* None  

Some 150 million years ago, prehistoric fish swimming in the sponge and coral reefs of what is now southern Germany might not have suspected there was a piranha-like predator prowling among them. But by the time they realized the danger -- CHOMP! -- the sneaky creature would have bitten off one of their fins. Back then, these waters were teeming with bony fish called pycnodontiformes, which were known for their crushing teeth that were likely used for smashing snail shells and sea urchin spines. Scientists thought, for the most part, that other fish were not on their menu. But now, researchers have found a pycnodontiform with razor-sharp teeth that they think ripped chunks of flesh, especially fins, from other fish. They named it Piranhamesodon pinnatomus. The finding, published Thursday in the journal Current Biology, represents the earliest record of flesh-eating in bony fish and may cause scientists to rethink the predatory practices of this group. ""It's a wolf in sheep's skin,"" said Martina Kolbl-Ebert, a vertebrate paleontologist and director of the Jura-Museum Eichstatt in Germany. ""This one had daggers and scissors in the mouth, implying a completely different mode of feeding."" [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] With scalpels, fine-needles and a microscope, Dr. Kolbl-Ebert and her colleagues examined the fossil in 2016. It came from the same fossil deposit where scientists first discovered Archaeopteryx, the famous feathered dinosaur. This area was most likely a shallow tropical sea dotted with small islands inhabited by insects, lizards and dinosaurs when the piranha-like fish was alive, according to Dr. Kolbl-Ebert. After extracting the fossil from the rocks, they performed a micro-CT scan on the specimen. Although the Piranhamesodon pinnatomus may have looked like other colorful coral fish from the outside, there were major differences inside its mouth. Most pycnodonts had front teeth shaped like chisels that they used for grasping, as well as flat, cobble-shaped teeth for crushing. But the new species, just a few inches in length, had six long, pointed knifelike teeth that were slightly curved backward as well as six triangular teeth with serrated edges. ""We were stunned that this fish had piranha-like teeth,"" said Dr. Kolbl-Ebert. While its pycnodont relatives mostly swallowed their prey whole, the sharp teeth of the newly discovered fish would have allowed it to munch on prey that was much larger than itself. According to the researchers, prehistoric sharks and sea turtles were the only other known flesh-eaters in those waters, known as the Solnhofen Archipelago, during the period known as the Late Jurassic. That made Piranhamesodon pinnatomus a pioneer among bony fish when it came to slicing up prey. The team said they are not certain if Piranhamesodon pinnatomus ate live fish or if it was a scavenger. But fossils of fish with missing or bitten fins suggest the fish nipped at the appendages of unwary fish while they were still alive, a practice seen in modern piranhas. ""If you bite a fish in the belly it might die and then it's lost,"" said Dr. Kolbl-Ebert, ""but if you just nibble bits from the fin it will regrow and you can do it all over again.""",A fossil discovered in southern Germany is the earliest known flesh-eating bony fish.,e586e3ac-d605-5b90-bb21-60b634922080,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/23/science/19TB-PIRANHA3/19TB-PIRANHA3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=ace0202c9966b86bd9af2a0a7520029c68103d77b06d5de597a1c69fd3c90d15&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Piranhamesodon pinnatomus, a fish of the late Jurassic with sharp teeth, inset, that would have allowed it to eat prey much larger than itself, like modern piranhas.",e586e3ac-d605-5b90-bb21-60b634922080,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1e586e3ac-d605-5b90-bb21-60b634922080.jpg,2,20
Automobiles,Deer Mating Season: Drivers Beware,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/automobiles/deer-mating-season-drivers-beware.html,"It's the deadliest time of the year for deer, which also pose a particular danger to motorists in autumn with the arrival of the mating and hunting seasons. Nearly half of vehicle accidents involving white-tail deer occur from October to December, according to Chad Stewart, a deer research biologist at the Indiana State Division of Fish and Wildlife. ""With the number of deer and the number of vehicles out there, deer-vehicle accidents will happen,"" Mr. Stewart said. ""The best thing drivers can do is to take measures to keep them to a minimum."" The confluence of mating and hunting seasons makes November the month with the most deer-vehicle collisions -- about 18 percent of the annual total -- according to State Farm.

In 2001-11, collisions with animals resulted in 2,083 fatal crashes nationwide, according to AAA's examination of data from the federal Fatality Analysis Reporting System. In New York state, there were about 35,000 reported deer crashes in 2011, the latest data available, according to Carol Breen, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Department. That year, four people were killed and 1,311 injured in deer-related accidents. And while deer collisions tend to get the most attention, encounters with smaller animals like squirrels, raccoons and dogs also cause drivers to veer and crash, noted William Van Tassel, who leads AAA's national driver training programs. He recommends that drivers entering a roadway -- especially from sunset to sunrise -- scan the area continuously and play a ""what-if game"" a couple of times. ""What if a deer or animal runs out in front of me -- what should I be doing?"" Mr. Van Tassel said. This allows drivers to prime their brain, hands and feet, he said, ""to do what they need to do, just in case.""

Among the driving tips offered by the Insurance Information Institute are these: be aware that deer tend to travel in groups; that they are most active in the evening, around 6 to 9 p.m.; and that they can be highly unpredictable, especially when caught in headlights, exposed to loud noises like horns or confused by fast-moving vehicles. The institute says drivers should not rely on devices like car-mounted deer whistles or roadside reflectors, which despite advertising claims have not proved effective at keeping deer out of a vehicle's path. In a recent study of fatal animal crashes, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that 60 percent of the people who died were not wearing safety belts. ""Most of the human deaths could be prevented if every driver buckled up and every motorcyclist wore a helmet,"" said Russ Rader, the organization's senior vice president for communications. Recently, State Farm noted a 3.5 percent drop in deer collisions nationwide, to 1.22 million, for the one-year period ending on June 30, 2013. It said the odds of a driver striking a deer had declined by 4.3 percent from the period a year earlier. However, State Farm said the average deer-collision damage claim in that period had risen 3.3 percent, to $3,414. Using its own claims data and drivers' license information, the insurer said in September that it had calculated the chances of a driver hitting a deer over the next 12 months to be 1 in 174, down from 1 in 167 in its estimate for the previous year. Chris Mullen, director of strategic resources at State Farm, said that it was hard to pinpoint a single reason for the decline, but that factors like driver awareness, deer-crossing signs, fences and technology might have contributed. A disease that reduced the deer population last year may also be a factor, Mr. Stewart of Indiana said. In 2012, he said, deer were hit hard by epizootic hemorrhagic disease, which spread particularly during drought conditions in states including Indiana. The disease is not as much of a factor this year, he added.

In New York, one element that helped to make 2012 the safest year in the nearly six decades of the New York Thruway, with a total of 2,053 incidents, was the addition of deer-crossing signs at locations with a higher-than-average history of vehicle-deer collisions, said Dan Weiller, a spokesman for the New York State Thruway Authority. Those high-traffic areas included Westchester and Rockland counties in the lower Hudson Valley. ""We analyze all accidents that occur on the Thruway to determine if there are changes we can make in the roadway to lessen the chance of recurrence of a similar accident,"" he said. The Thruway is on track for another decline in deer collisions, with 1,052 reported through September. To be sure, technology like night-vision systems and pedestrian-avoidance systems may be aiding some drivers as well, according to Mr. Rader of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. He noted that for the first time in September, the group issued crash-avoidance ratings. What's more, automakers are starting to roll out animal-detection technology. The 2014 Mercedes-Benz S-Class is now available with a third-generation infrared night-vision system developed by Autoliv Electronics Night Vision, that detects animals in the car's path and alerts the driver. The system will soon be offered on some Audis and BMWs. Volvo is also working to develop an animal-detection system. The unit of Autoliv, a large Swedish supplier of auto safety systems, says its system allows drivers to detect wildlife and pedestrians ""in about 150 milliseconds, which is as fast as a blink of the eye."" Once the infrared unit detects a hazard, the system provides visual and audible warnings to alert the driver about a potential collision. It has a range of about 525 feet. ""In the future,"" said Mr. Rader of the insurance institute, ""we can foresee that some of these systems will be beneficial in preventing both pedestrian collisions and collisions with animals.""","Nearly half of vehicle accidents involving white-tail deer occur from October to December, with November the worst month.",85a7e765-4769-5c3e-9e0b-ca61c54f0419,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/03/automobiles/DEER/DEER-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=255&w=600&s=1652066fc01cd952a3ef992c6e3e06ff2964f075d3a10d1f61c9c1813969b1c6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A close call for a buck on Mill Road in East Aurora, N.Y., in September 2012.",85a7e765-4769-5c3e-9e0b-ca61c54f0419,Demo_data/D1_imgs/185a7e765-4769-5c3e-9e0b-ca61c54f0419.jpg,23,23
Style,This Woman Wants to Help Regulate Your Period With Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/style/self-care/flo-living-pcos-periods.html,"This Woman Wants to Help Regulate Your Period With Food

A few months ago, in a conference room at the Yard , a co-working space in Manhattan, a group of female employees were updating their boss, Alisa Vitti , on their latest projects and the state of their hormones. ""I'm in my luteal phase right now, so very into organization,"" said one woman, citing the second phase of her menstrual cycle as explanation for the series of perfectly structured charts she was presenting on a screen at the front of the room. Ms . Vitti, 42, the founder of Flo Living, a lifestyle company focused on female health and nutrition , listened as she drank water and herbal tea. She has been caffeine-, dairy -, gluten- and sugar-free for 20 years, and maintains that the shift helped cure her of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) she struggled with since she was a teenager. That recovery has also informed her professional mission -- to spread a gospel of dietary and lifestyle changes that may help women dealing with complex and confounding hormonal issues, usually related to their periods.

There are some tips that Ms. Vitti dispenses somewhat universally: Eat fermented foods like kimchi and sauerkraut to help support your microbiome; avoid consuming large quantities of sugar; and eliminate dairy, which she sees as a root cause for issues like PCOS, acne and endometriosis. Ms. Vitti does not have a medical degree. After studying for two years at the Integrative Institute of Nutrition, a licensed vocation school, she quit a job in marketing and apprenticed for a few years with alternative medicine practitioners. In 2000, she started her own walk-in clinic in Manhattan . By 2010, she said she was seeing around six patients every day, often during after-work hours, and receiving hundreds of emails from women in Europe and India seeking her advice. That year, she closed the clinic to focus on expanding the practice into a digital brand. Dr. Elizabeth Fino, a reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist at the New York University Langone Fertility Center who is familiar with Ms. Vitti's work, agrees that diet and lifestyle shifts should be the first line of treatment for women facing hormonal issues like PCOS. But she also believes that modern medical treatment -- for example, taking birth control to regularize periods -- is often the best and most realistic option. (Ms. Vitti is pro birth control in general, but does not encourage it as a treatment for existing hormonal imbalances.) ""Her approach takes significant dedication on the patient's part, and it's just not attainable for a lot of people,"" said Dr. Fino, noting how expensive and time consuming it can be to follow a clean eating regimen. Ms. Vitti's supplement kit, for example, which includes a 60-day supply of five different supplements including fish oil and magnesium, costs $215. That's about $1,200 a year. The language Ms. Vitti's employees use is pulled from ""WomanCode,"" a book she published in 2013. Referred to by fans as ""the purple period bible,"" the book offers women alternative strategies for dealing with tough hormonal issues, including endometriosis and cystic acne.

Its treatment suggestions are meant to replace medicines like spironolactone and ibuprofen that many gynecologists rely on for symptom management. The approach is grounded in a concept of ""cycle-syncing,"" or catering one's diet, exercise and lifestyle habits to the four phases of the menstrual cycle (luteal, menstrual , follicular and ovulatory). Within each menstrual phase, women's hormones shift, causing energy levels and dietary needs to shift as well, Ms. Vitti said. During the luteal phase, for example, ""WomanCode"" recommends that women eat roasted vegetables to stave off increased sugar cravings, and increase their intake of leafy greens to ward off bloating. Unlike during the follicular and ovulatory phases, when Ms. Vitti said women have the most energy, exercise during the luteal phase should be less intensive -- think gentle yoga or light weights.

For Nashira Arno , a 30-year-old jewelry designer in Brooklyn, discovering ""WomanCode"" gave her hope. ""I've had a horrible period -- not a bad period, a horrible period -- since I was 13,"" said Ms. Arno, who grew up in the Dominican Republic. As a teenager, she would have to go to the emergency room because of the severity of her cramps. She received no diagnosis, she said, and a stream of heavy-duty painkillers that didn't solve the problem. Eventually, she felt even worse. By the time she came across ""WomanCode"" at age 29, she had written off doctors altogether.

Once she made the dietary shifts recommended by Ms. Vitti, she said, her cramps went from a pain level of 20 to 5, her once acne-prone skin cleared up, and she had fewer digestion issues. ""I've always been healthy-ish, but now I look at food as medicine,"" said Ms. Arno, who takes supplements recommended by Ms. Vitti, including vitamin B6 and magnesium. ""WomanCode"" is part of the larger Flo Living brand, which includes a digital clinic, a period tracking app and hormonal supplements. The company's ""Monthly Flo Program,"" which costs $297, provides educational videos. Thousands of women have signed up for one or all of these offerings. ""I think most people today understand that there's a clear overlap between your diet and lifestyle and how these things impact you medically,"" Ms. Vitti said.

""It's a lot, and that's coming from me, a person who takes 500 different, obscure vitamins every morning,"" said Ariana Cleo, a 26-year-old founder of a wellness public relations firm. A few years ago, Ms. Cleo took a fertility test and was told by a doctor that she had diminished ovarian reserves. She is now using Ms. Vitti's period tracking app to monitor her hormones while also eating more food -- specifically more carbs and protein -- which is all in line with the Flo Protocol. When she feels the need to rest, she is trying to honor that, instead of pushing through a SoulCycle class like she would have in the past. ""Alisa's teachings are all about tapping into our feminine energy -- being intuitive, compassionate and empathetic towards our bodies -- and resisting the masculine drive to succeed at all costs and just go, go, go,"" she said. There are some who have serious reservations about the approach. Dr. Jennifer Conti, an adjunct clinical professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, wrote in an email that the fixation on so-called hormone imbalances may be ""on-trend,"" but ""in reality, hormones are necessary, fluctuating chemicals our body needs for a variety of everyday functions."" Women who have a condition like PCOS, she said, should ""talk with their gynecologist about creating a shared decision-making goal for management."" Still, many women feel supported by Ms. Vitti's approach. After Nicole Gulotta, 37, of Raleigh, N.C., struggled to get pregnant and then suffered a miscarriage in 2013, she followed the Flo Protocol for a year. She became pregnant and gave birth to a boy in October 2015. To her, there was a clear connection. ""The program helped me uncover the root cause of my symptoms and also release some emotional blockages that were holding me back,"" Ms. Gulotta said.",Can dietary and lifestyle changes help women dealing with complex and confounding hormonal issues?

Movies,'Socrates' Review: Surviving on the Streets of São Paulo,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/movies/socrates-review.html,"Directed and co-written by the young Brazilian-American filmmaker Alexandre Moratto, this passionate first feature crams a lot of drama into its brief 71 minutes. Stingy with details but expansive with scene-setting and characterization, Moratto and his artful cinematographer, Joao Gabriel de Queiroz, hold fast to Socrates as his problems mount. A chance meeting at a junkyard introduces romance in the form of the brooding Maicon (Tales Ordakji), but the older man's complicated home life -- and the region's rampant homophobia -- only increase the boy's troubles. Broke and hungry and increasingly isolated, he tries to reconnect with the father (Jaime Rodrigues) he and his mother had previously fled. It does not go well.

Using a mostly teenage crew (as part of a project to involve low-income Brazilian youths in filmmaking), Moratto allows Socrates's drive and resourcefulness to determine the movie's mood. Simple yet effective audio and visual distortions remind us that this is a kid in shock, someone with neither time nor means to process his bereavement. As such, ""Socrates"" isn't simply about being gay, or poor, or even devastatingly unloved: It's about honoring a resilience that most of us will thankfully never have to summon.

Art & Design,Oprah Earned This Museum Show. And It's a Potent Spectacle.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/arts/design/oprah-winfrey-smithsonian-national-museum-of-african-american-history-and-culture.html,"WASHINGTON -- Has any American spent more of her career flinging her arms up in shock and elation than Oprah Winfrey? Maybe -- maybe -- certain long-suffering and spoiled-rotten sports fans. But in 25 years of hosting a daytime talk show five days a week, nine months out of 12, often to gigantic ratings, Ms. Winfrey raised her arms a lot -- over makeovers and giveaways and celebrity surprises, like that time, in 2011, nearing the final broadcast of ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" when she turned around and saw Stevie Wonder, at a piano, rising out of an arena floor. O.K., it was only one arm, but it went up with the force of two. Her reaction was part ""buzzer beater,"" part ""pageant win."" She and her thousands of hours of TV are now the subjects of a big, fascinating exhibition at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture that captures what the show was, did and has meant. And it includes that Stevie Wonder moment, in a short montage focused on the show's leap, in its final years, into lavish, thrill-a-minute mega-production.

That bit with Mr. Wonder lasts about 15 seconds in the montage. But it sticks with you. For one thing, it exposes something endearingly normal in a woman, who as a very famous TV host, could presumably have had Mr. Wonder pop out of any floor anytime she wanted. For another, the women in the audience (thousands of them, black and white; I didn't spot a single man) leap and shout and wail, with their arms in the air, in a dozen different ways, from ""Lotto win"" to ""praise Jesus."" They're going nuts for Mr. Wonder, obviously. But they might be more ecstatic about the joy he's bringing Ms. Winfrey. This isn't a cult, exactly. It's a living, screaming symbiotic social network. Affirmation and intent became muscular cornerstones of the ""Oprah Winfrey"" enterprise. When she banged the ""like"" button, her vast constituency banged on it, too.

The show's been off the air for seven years, and we miss it: More than a year before ""Watching Oprah,"" Chicago's WBEZ released the podcast ""Making Oprah,"" a delicious behind-the-scenes casserole that Jenn White served with a fan's appreciation and a critic's forensic eye. And Ms. Winfrey hasn't disappeared at all. Since ""Oprah"" went off the air, Winfrey has evolved into an even more instinctive screen actress, for one thing. She's written books; she's vividly alive on Instagram, her cable network and wellness podcast; and she looked supremely tickled to be at Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding last month. And yet, if America can't actually miss Oprah Winfrey, it might miss an idea of her. As ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" Oprah, a totem of humanity, respect, largess and fun. As a figure of immense, almost assaultive generosity, who could unleash, in us, bombastic yet utterly sincere gratitude. Maybe the chaos extremity of current events has made us wistful for the moral authority of ""Oprah Winfrey"": school massacres, police shootings of unarmed black people, men chronically mistreating women, the government's separation of children from their migrant parents. Whenever somebody pleads for a national conversation -- about anything, really -- what they're saying is, ""Where the hell is Oprah?""

To the extent that ""queen of daytime"" is any kind of office, it's one Ms. Winfrey has never abused. She loves people, and she seems to understand the intensity of people's love for her. But people also love power, and Ms. Winfrey's display of it that night (and perhaps a New York Post column she retweeted) sparked pandemonium for her to ride it into Washington. President Oprah was fantasized about as an antidote to a caustic, whimsical president: the woman with the extensive ""angel network"" taking on a master Twitter troll, one television genius locking horns with another. But the Smithsonian show leaves you thinking that she'd probably expect better fantasies from us. It makes you think she might be too good for whatever a candidate would have to do or say in this political climate to be elected president of anything. BEFORE YOU EXIT ""Watching Oprah,"" you've scrutinized a case full of childhood photos, diary entries, high school letters and a signed copy of Maya Angelou's ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."" You've soaked up the music, speeches, imagery and writing in a room devoted to the musicians, actors, authors and political movements that helped a young Oprah determine who she wanted to be. You've checked out the amusingly arranged spot devoted to her Oscar-losing performance in ""The Color Purple"" (she had her Oscar luncheon biscuit bronzed, instead) and the space that enumerates her early television-news work, including a three-minute montage of her in Baltimore and Chicago in the 1970s and 1980s that is one of the most charming pieces of editing you're going to see. At some point, a young Ms. Winfrey, in spandex, has to put her legs up for an aerobics-class segment and jestingly complains, ""Oh, you're gonna love this shot.""

You wonder whether the show's integrationist philosophy arises from its host's having been raised, reared and professionally trained in Milwaukee, Mississippi, Tennessee and the broadcast environs of Baltimore and Chicago. Just geographically, Ms. Winfrey is intersectional. But it also explains something like the trip the show took in 1987 to Forsyth County, Ga., after it purged itself of nearly all its black residents. She wanted to know what about black people so scared the white residents, and she keeps having to remind the racists in her audience that the woman interrogating them is also black. Ms. Winfrey contributed more than $20 million to the sponsorship of the museum. So there's an urge to distrust the intent of an exhibition like this, to say that she bought it. But her museum donation doesn't seem at all like vanity. It's ""how to use your life,"" ""what do you stand for"" money. Across from ""A People's Journey"" sits the Oprah Winfrey Theater. Maybe she paid for a piece of that. Anyway, our tax dollars are hard at work here, too. So Ms. Winfrey just paid a little more than I did. Nonetheless, ""Watching Oprah,"" in its uncompromised captioning, goes out of its way to remind you about the chronic dissatisfaction, among some black people, with the lack of attention to the crises of black America. The show includes a 1986 letter from a black woman upset that Ms. Winfrey didn't call on her during a broadcast because she didn't ""look like an ugly, fat, uneducated, frustrated black woman which is typical of the majority of the women you allow to speak on your show."" If that was ever true (suburban white women made up its biggest demographic), it wasn't that way for long.

This might be the only show in television history to feature a ferocious four-way argument among black women about being a Republican. You watch a moment like that, in the exhibition's ""Talk-Back TV"" montage, and you remember the show's deep roots as a roving dialogue, often through national events, tragedies and disasters, with Ms. Winfrey holding the microphone (several of which are on display). It was a show that, in 1992, devoted a handful of daring episodes to racism, including a couple after the Los Angeles riots and one that featured a panel of American Indians and a white audience actually hearing the panelists' dismay. Even when it was in the mud, ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" was determined to make so-called rednecks understand the problem with""redskins."" ONE PROBLEM WITH being really good at your job is that people won't let you stop doing it. But you watch enough of these montages and realize two things. First, ""Watching Oprah"" needs a lot more of ""Oprah"" to watch, more clips, segments, whole episodes, something. Second, Oprah didn't do this work alone. She helped us do it. She was a platform. She was Facebook. Forget the presidency. She was the facilitator in chief. The more she empowered us to speak, the better she got at knowing how her emotional algorithm could supply us with books and feelings and tools for betterment. And she took real risks to better understand this country, too. That Forsyth County episode might have been a stunt, but it's more audacious than Geraldo Rivera's dragging millions of Americans into a bloody brawl with skinheads the following year. ""Watching Oprah"" doesn't privilege any one episode over any other. So it's hard, at first, to see what exactly it is about the show that matters. But then you think about that massive wall of episode titles and how it's impossible to take it all the way in. And that incomprehensible vastness seems perfectly right, both for the enduring vitality of the show itself and the woman at its center.",An exhibition at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture captures what Oprah Winfrey and her TV show have meant.,4fd57ef1-a908-5e61-9602-2cfe4fbef7b1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/22/arts/22OPRAH-TOP/22OPRAH-TOP-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=514&w=983&s=e06bf2f8c1f02f18be7d8c5edf29b8f0c172a1389222ee564fc22e854dd0e439&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Scenes from a career: clockwise from top left, Oprah Winfrey greeting fans in 2010 in Sydney, Australia; in host mode with Nelson Mandela in 2000, a Georgia resident in 1987, and Barack Obama in 2006; revealing her post-diet body in 1988; and leaving audience members rapt in 2010 after announcing their impending travel to Australia.",4fd57ef1-a908-5e61-9602-2cfe4fbef7b1,Demo_data/D1_imgs/14fd57ef1-a908-5e61-9602-2cfe4fbef7b1.jpg,14,3
Dance,Review: A Festival Invigorates José Limón's Legacy,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/arts/dance/review-a-festival-invigorates-jose-limons-legacy.html,"For the Jose Limon International Dance Festival, now in its second and final week at the Joyce Theater, the Limon Dance Company has invited troupes from across the country and the world to join it in performing the work of its namesake choreographer, who died in 1972. The intention is to show the spread of Limon's legacy, but during Program C on Tuesday, that wasn't the only effect.

Members of sjDANCEco, a company founded in San Jose, Calif., by the former Limon dancer Gary Masters, performed ""Mazurkas,"" Limon's 1958 suite of dances to Chopin. They did not perform it very well. Even apart from the wobbles and stumbles, the dancing was tentative and imprecise, only in the general vicinity of the choreography's shapes and rhythms.

In the context of the festival, though, this subpar performance functioned as a reminder of how hard it is to get Limon right -- not just how physically difficult the movements are, but also how much concentration and faith it takes to keep the style from seeming irredeemably antiquated and hokey. The failure of sjDANCEco in this respect set into relief the amazingness of what the Limon Dance Company regularly accomplishes.

On Program C, the host troupe had less to work with than on previous programs. ""Carlota"" was the last piece that Limon made before his death, and it's a weaker version of earlier dramas. It is about the Empress Carlota, whose husband, Maximilian, was the short-reigning Hapsburg emperor of Mexico (Limon's home country), until he was executed in 1867. The original dancer in the title role was Carla Maxwell, who has heroically served as the company's artistic director since 1978 and recently announced her plans to retire.","Program C of the José Limón International Dance Festival at the Joyce Theater featured the choreographer's ""Carlota,"" ""Mazurkas"" and ""There Is a Time.""",f7698b1d-e36c-5098-8c51-d22858814f4c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/arts/23LIMON/23LIMON-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=d10a1b608ffcc92bcd63b94c3ac5d9af4a13a7b9beff55a3e1942cc58ab1ddf2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Ross Katen, Mark Willis and Brenna Monroe-Cook of the Limón Dance Company performing in ""Carlota"" at the Joyce Theater.",f7698b1d-e36c-5098-8c51-d22858814f4c,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1f7698b1d-e36c-5098-8c51-d22858814f4c.jpg,6,10
Economy,"No, the Jobs Report Wasn't Rigged. Here's What Happened.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/business/economy/jobs-report-data.html,"When the Labor Department reported on Friday that employers had added jobs in May and that the unemployment rate had unexpectedly fallen, economists were surprised. Others had a different reaction: suspicion. Social media sites over the weekend lit up with posts, some from Democratic politicians, saying the jobs numbers were misleading at best and possibly manipulated. ""The trump folks fudged the figures,"" Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and Democratic national chairman, said on Twitter. For many, those suspicions seemed confirmed by a note, deep within the report, saying some workers had been improperly counted as employed rather than unemployed. If those workers had been classified correctly, the unemployment rate would have been about 16.4 percent in May, rather than the official rate of 13.3 percent (although it still would have been lower than in April). But economists across the political spectrum say it would be all but impossible to manipulate the jobs numbers undetected. And while there is no question that the speed and severity of the economic collapse has made gathering and interpreting economic data unusually difficult, they say the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- the Labor Department office that produces the jobs report -- has done an admirable job both ensuring that the numbers are reliable and publicly identifying potential issues.

""The B.L.S. acted with enormous integrity and transparency,"" said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who led the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama. ""If anything, it's another example of how honest and by the book they are."" Moreover, Mr. Furman said, the essence of Friday's jobs report is the same regardless of the classification issue: The unemployment rate fell somewhat in May from the previous month, but remains higher than at any other point since the Great Depression.

Here are some of the basics behind the numbers. Why is there ambiguity about the unemployment rate? In its report on Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics identified what it called a ""misclassification error,"" in which some people were mistakenly characterized as employed rather than unemployed. The same issue showed up in data from March and April. To understand what happened, it helps to know a bit about how the jobs figures are calculated. The unemployment rate and related statistics are based on a monthly survey of about 60,000 households. Interviewers, who work for the Census Bureau, ask respondents a series of questions about their activity the previous week to figure out whether they should count as employed, unemployed or out of the labor force entirely.

When the coronavirus pandemic began, the Bureau of Labor Statistics decided that anyone who wasn't working because of virus-related business closings should count as unemployed, with or without a formal layoff notice. But starting in March, the agency noticed that an unusual number of people were being counted as ""employed but absent from work"" -- a category meant to reflect vacation, family leave or other temporary absences. The bureau estimates that this issue probably affected about five million people in May. If all the potentially misclassified people had been counted as unemployed, the jobless rate would have been about a point higher in March, five points higher in April and three points higher in May. It's worth noting that the May report's other surprising number -- a gain of 2.5 million jobs -- was based on a separate survey of businesses, and was therefore unaffected by the classification issue. Why hasn't the problem been fixed? It isn't clear why people are still being misclassified three months into the pandemic. The bureau says it and the Census Bureau are ""investigating why this misclassification error continues to occur and are taking additional steps to address the issue.""

* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. But Erica Groshen, a Cornell University economist who ran the Bureau of Labor Statistics under Mr. Obama, said it was not surprising that a survey intended to measure the ordinary fluctuations in the job market might struggle to capture the nuances of a pandemic-driven shutdown of a vast portion of the economy. And once the survey has been completed, the agency is extremely reluctant to make any changes, Ms. Groshen said -- in part because doing so would invite charges that the agency was massaging the numbers for political or other reasons. ""That would open up a Pandora's box of 'Why don't you adjust for this or that,'"" she said. Instead, she said, the agency highlights unusual issues in the data, allowing economists and other observers to adjust the numbers as they see fit.

""That's part of the transparency that they've built into the process,"" she said. Are there other issues with the jobs numbers? The pandemic has made it more difficult for the government to reach households and businesses to conduct surveys, in part because in-person interviews are suspended. The response rate in the survey of households was 67 percent in May, compared with 83 percent in February, before most of the pandemic-related shutdowns. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said it was ""still able to obtain estimates that met our standards for accuracy and reliability,"" but economists say the numbers may be less reliable than usual. Virus-related disruptions could skew the data in other ways. They have thrown off typical seasonal patterns of hiring and firing, which are ordinarily factored into the results, and have scrambled usual assumptions about how many businesses are being formed or shutting down permanently. How could economists have gotten it so wrong? Economists overwhelmingly expected Friday's report to show a loss of jobs and an increase in the unemployment rate. But that shouldn't necessarily sow suspicion. For one thing, economists are notoriously bad at predicting turning points in the economy. They didn't see the 2008-9 recession coming until it had begun. In this case, economists thought that job losses continued in May largely because millions of people were filing for unemployment benefits. The data released on Friday agreed: It showed that job losses were elevated in May.

""The numbers are real -- I just think we got blindsided because we got too focused on claims,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He noted that data from private sources, such as air travel and restaurant bookings, began to improve in mid-April, which is consistent with the modest rebound shown in the jobs report. How do we know the numbers aren't rigged? This isn't the first time that prominent people have questioned the jobs numbers. In 2012, Jack Welch, the former General Electric chief, implied that ""Chicago guys"" in the Obama administration had rigged a jobs report to help the president win re-election. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Donald Trump called the unemployment rate, then at 5 percent, ""one of the biggest hoaxes in American modern politics."" But as my colleague Patricia Cohen wrote at the time, there are many protections in place to ensure that the jobs numbers and other economic indicators are kept free of politics. And Ms. Groshen and other economists said they had seen no evidence that has changed under Mr. Trump. ""I have seen no red flags, anything to suggest that the numbers are rigged,"" Ms. Groshen said. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is headed by a political appointee, currently William W. Beach, who previously served as a Republican Senate staff member and an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. But the rest of the bureau is staffed by career employees, many predating the Trump administration. Ms. Groshen and other economists say those employees, whom she called ""the most dedicated data nerds on the face of the earth,"" would raise alarms if they saw signs of political interference. And there is virtually no way the numbers could be changed without their noticing, she said.",The pandemic has complicated the usual methods and models for compiling employment data.

Travel,36 Hours in Chattanooga,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/travel/what-to-do-chattanooga.html,"Nearly geeky in its optimism -- and all the better for it -- this friendly Tennessee city is a breath of fresh air.

Nestled against the Tennessee River in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, Chattanooga, Tenn., has transformed itself in recent decades from an unassuming town to a hyper clean, high-tech (""Gig City"" was the first in the United States to offer gigabit internet speeds), outdoorsy family destination that offers hiking trails, rock climbing, museums, one of the finest educational aquariums in the world, and innumerable food and entertainment venues. Families can share experiences that lean more toward kayaking and mountain biking than meeting Mickey or riding Space Mountain, though the region has a number of its own natural rides (white-water rafting on the nearby Ocoee River, for example, and Lookout Mountain Hang Gliding school is just 20 minutes away). The region ""where cotton meets corn"" is evident in Chattanooga's straddling of two cultures: the mountain communities of Southern Appalachia to the north and the cotton-growing states to the south. Nearly geeky in its optimism -- and all the better for it -- Chattanooga is a breath of fresh air.

Start out slow at the Hunter Museum of American Art in the Bluff View Arts District overlooking the Tennessee River. The outstanding collection -- housed in an early 20th-century mansion, a modern 1970s-era building and a contemporary structure of steel and glass -- represents the sprawling artistic talent of the American soul, from the Colonial period to the present day, with works by Thomas Cole, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Helen Frankenthaler, among many others. There is also photography by Lorna Simpson and Sally Mann, and glass works by Karen LaMonte and Dale Chihuly, and, for children, plenty of hands-on activities. Adult admission: $15. Children under 17: free.

There will soon be action verbs in your sentences, so head to nearby Tony's Pasta Shop & Trattoria in a former carriage house of a Victorian mansion for some fancy carb loading that won't break the bank. Just about everything here is made from scratch and time tested. Grab a seat on the upper deck under the wisteria, and try the Low Country linguine with sauteed crawfish and mushrooms ($13) or seafood ravioli with dill sauce ($14). Warning: It's all too easy to gorge on the olive oil dip with bits of pecorino, so go easy. Avoid the tourist crush at Ruby Falls by opting for the lesser-known Ruby Falls Lantern Tour, which squires and schools small groups through the Lookout Mountain Caves to a 145-foot waterfall more than 1,000 feet below the surface, and named after the wife of its discoverer. The tour traverses a maze of corridors with formations the guides explain along the way. At some point, the guide will require participants to turn off their lanterns to experience total darkness, but not after hitting the switch on the falls' spectacular light show. Lantern Tours are available from February through November and cost $29.95.

After breakfast (suggestion: alderwood-smoked salmon frittata for $8.75 at The Bluegrass Grill) make your way to Zip Stream Aerial Adventure, also at Ruby Falls. Zip-lining is fast becoming a bucket list item for many outdoor enthusiasts, and this zip line run is family friendly -- for those who can reach up to 70 inches and whose weight falls between 60 and 275 pounds. Choose from one of the courses developed for children that include tunnels, zigzag bridges and swinging logs with zip-lining at the end. Just want to fly through the pines at about 35 miles per hour? The park offers a zip-line experience, a la carte, for $29.95.

This isn't the time to steer away from fried food. Family-owned Uncle Larry's fries up fresh catfish to something close to sublime. Tilapia and other fish, shrimp and pork chops are on the menu, but it's the delicately battered catfish that keeps the locals coming back. It all started at a family reunion when the owner, Larry Torrance, was goaded into going commercial. Two large pieces of fish with two sides and a soda will set you back about $14. Add on a slice of key lime cake ($3.35) to complete the diet fail -- it's worth it.

New to the Chattanooga Choo Choo campus on Station Street and gaining national attention for its rare vintage guitar collection, Songbirds Guitar Museum is a staggering compilation that appeals to both guitar connoisseurs and those who wouldn't know a Fender from a fender. The self-guided tour takes patrons through the origins of rock 'n' roll, showcasing music history from the 1930s through the 1970s ($15). There is a collection of custom-color Stratocasters and one of the most complete sets of Gibson Firebirds, Telecasters, Esquires and Jazzmasters in the world. For $38.95, you can take a guided tour through ""the vault,"" which houses some extremely rare guitars. In the evening, consider a visit to the museum's live venue, Songbirds South. V isit bikechattanooga.com, then find one of the numerous bike stations close to the waterfront. For $8 an hour, you can bike along the river and past the diverse merchants on Broad Street and its environs. Take a nostalgic trip through Americana at the Moon Pie General Store, a novelty gift shop where Moon Pies are still made, or help create your own glass ornament at Ignis Glass Studio (Ignis suggests calling first: 423-265-2565). Find time to get to Highpoint Climbing and Fitness Gym to watch people scaling the gym's surreal 60-foot-high outdoor climbing wall. Or send the young ones (or yourself) scrambling skyward.

The Boathouse Rotisserie & Raw Bar is one of the few foodie haunts in Chattanooga situated right on the Tennessee River. Ask the bartender about the Boathouse's Sips program, which allows one to taste any of the 16 rotating high-end wines at a fraction of the cost. The ""sips"" are four ounces. The minimum is $10, and there is no cap. The massive deck that surrounds the restaurant blasts heaters that keep diners warm in cooler seasons. Try the Lotta Lotta Garlic Chicken with arugula, pineapple, tomatoes, avocado and feta cheese ($17) or go old school with the wood-grilled rib eye ($35). Called one of the best-designed bars in the country by the Los Angeles chapter of the American Institute of Architects, The Flying Squirrel, in Chattanooga's hip Southside, is a gorgeous gastro pub built from remnants of a 115-year-old barn in McMinnville, Tenn. The menu is well thought out, and the cocktails are award winning. The Reverend (Elijah Craig Bourbon, Luxardo Maraschino liquor, Fernet, orange cream bitters and orange peel) was voted one of the best new cocktails by Restaurant Hospitality magazine. Or try the Electric Eye (New Amsterdam gin, Aperol, Lillet Blanc, orange bitters, orange, $9).

Head to the Tennessee Aquarium for a morning of water ballet. The mission of the aquarium -- which underwent a major expansion in 2005 -- is to connect the movement of water from the mountains to the sea with the beings that both live in or are dependent on the world's water system; it's a well-told conservation story that includes lemurs, birds, otters, penguins and a wondrous Butterfly Room. There are thousands of colorful reef fish, prehistoric-looking sturgeons, the nation's largest salamander and the feared red-bellied piranha. In Stingray Bay, guests can touch sharks and stingrays. The aquarium's app (tnaqua.org/app) tells users where experts will be throughout the day. Adult admission is $29.95; children 3 to 12, $18.95; under 3, free.

A few blocks from the aquarium is the entrance to the 2,376-foot-long Walnut Street Bridge, a Chattanooga centerpiece that is on the National Register of Historic Places. The pedestrian bridge connects the Bluff View Arts District to the city's vibrant North Shore, and is considered a ""linear park,"" with places of rest and bits about the bridge's history stationed along the way. At night, the bridge is nearly an aphrodisiac, lit up and reflecting across the water -- part City of Lights, part Bridge of Sighs. Make your way to Milk & Honey for homemade gelato; try the velvety coffee and cream gelato ($5.50) or choose a fresh paleta (a much-improved Popsicle) for $3. If shopping is on the schedule, this is the neighborhood to roam; the free-spirited North Shore merchants include art galleries, handmade jewelry and gift shops, clothing stores, cafes, tattoo parlors and record stores. If you're exiting Chatt Town on the south side, veer over to Rock City on Lookout Mountain to where -- ostensibly -- one can see seven states. All you have to do is stand there and take in the vista, and this one is grand. Once a Civil War fortification, the retro-chic The Dwell Hotel (120 East 10th Street; thedwellhotel.com; from $225) is a colorful boutique hotel that seems well-suited to the population Chattanooga serves particularly well -- the young and the cool. The DoubleTree by Hilton Downtown Chattanooga (407 Chestnut Street; doubletree3.hilton.com; rooms start at $175 per night) is in the heart of Chattanooga and close to many of the riverfront attractions, as well as the Bluff View Arts District. Amenities include a swimming pool; family packages are also available.",Nearly geeky in its optimism — and all the better for it — this friendly Tennessee city is a breath of fresh air.,aba6dece-c19b-5fda-95ed-296b8b604b5a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/03/travel/03Hours-Chattanooga1/03Hours-Chattanooga1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=05f39f63c0300baf7740e3a0f9e10143eeda2df72c8e9693cd4adf80eb2e9e65&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A view of the Tennessee River and the Hunter Museum of American Art from the Walnut Street Bridge.,aba6dece-c19b-5fda-95ed-296b8b604b5a,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1aba6dece-c19b-5fda-95ed-296b8b604b5a.jpg,4,20
Health,'The Drug Became His Friend': Pandemic Drives Hike in Opioid Deaths,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/health/coronavirus-opioids-addiction.html,"BARRE, Vermont -- On the first Friday in June, Jefrey Cameron, 29, left his home around midnight to buy heroin. He had been struggling with addiction for seven years but had seemingly turned a corner, holding down a job that he loved at Basil's Pizzeria, driving his teenage sister to the mall to go shopping and sharing a home with his grandmother. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit. When he returned home that night and tried the product, it was so potent that he fell and hit his head in the bathroom. Mr. Cameron texted a friend soon after, saying that he had messed up and would go to a 12-step meeting with a friend that weekend. ""I promise I'm good and I can't get in any more trouble tonight,"" he wrote. ""Sweet dreams, if you wake up before you hear from me definitely call me. The sooner I get up and into town the better."" When Mr. Cameron woke up, he used the rest of the powder -- largely fentanyl, not heroin, his family would later learn -- from a small bag with a bunny stamped on it. Less than five hours after he sent the text, his grandmother found him dead. In the six months since Covid-19 brought the nation to a standstill, the opioid epidemic has taken a sharp turn for the worse. More than 40 states have recorded increases in opioid-related deaths since the pandemic began, according to the American Medical Association. In Arkansas, the use of Narcan, an overdose-reversing drug, has tripled. Jacksonville, Fla., has seen a 40 percent increase in overdose-related calls. In March alone, York County in Pennsylvania recorded three times more overdose deaths than normal.

When Vermont shut down in March, so did Mr. Cameron's job, which provided his biggest support network. He was lonely and had money to spare: the $600 per week he received in extra unemployment benefits from the federal government was more than he earned from his job. ""Jefrey hated being alone. And the last couple of weeks, he was,"" said Ms. Reil, who is 47. His grandmother had gone to Atlanta to visit her other children and had delayed flying home for fear of catching Covid-19. In her absence, Mr. Cameron started keeping the television tuned to her favorite channel, blaring Western movies and ""Bonanza"" reruns. ""He was home alone a lot more,"" Ms. Reil said. ""And I think the drug became his friend."" Mr. Cameron had stopped taking Suboxone, a medication that helps suppress the cravings and withdrawal symptoms that plague people addicted to opioids, last fall; it has been found to sharply reduce the risk of dying from an overdose, but he had grown tired of taking it after three years, his mother said.

Opioid addiction has been a scourge in Vermont for more than two decades. When dealers and illegal drug organizations realized they could charge more for narcotics here than they could in nearby cities such as Boston, New York or Montreal, the market was flooded. As the painkillers that many young Vermonters became addicted to in the early 2000s grew harder to get starting about a decade ago, heroin moved in. Then came fentanyl, which is far more potent and has driven up deaths in almost every corner of the country. Last year, after aggressive efforts to expand access to treatment, Vermont saw its first decrease in opioid-related deaths since 2014; that year, then-Gov. Peter Shumlin devoted his entire State of the State Message to what he called ""a full-blown heroin crisis"" gripping Vermont. But Vermont saw 82 opioid overdoses through July of this year, up from 60 during the same period last year.

But in order to be admitted, patients have to test negative for Covid-19 -- a potentially deadly setback for some who are unable or unwilling to wait several days for results. Far more common than inpatient addiction care is treatment with three medications that help suppress the cravings and withdrawal symptoms that plague people addicted to opioids. Vermont has gone further than most states in expanding access to medication-assisted treatment, as it is known; at least 8,960 residents -- about 1.5 percent of the state's population -- were taking one of the three medications, buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone, during the first quarter of this year. Once the pandemic began, the federal government tried to make it easier for patients to stay on these medications while doctors' offices and clinics were generally closed and people were being asked to stay home. Nik Rowley, 37, has been taking a daily dose of Suboxone -- a brand name for buprenorphine -- for about eight years.

Mr. Rowley was getting back on his feet after being hospitalized for pneumonia when the pandemic hit. With nowhere else to go, he found housing in a hotel through a state-funded program to keep residents off the streets. The extra supply of medication helped him avoid drugs, but in his hotel room, he relapsed on alcohol. ""I had a few beers at the hotel because you're stuck in a room all by yourself,"" he said. ""You have nothing to do. So all you do is sit there and ruminate and your depression gets worse."" Brattleboro has several hotels that the state helped convert into temporary housing units for homeless and other at-risk people. Groundworks, a year-round housing service in Windham County, typically places 33 people in hotels during the winter months; in the spring, the number swelled to 150. Many of the recent lethal overdoses in the town have taken place at those hotels. ""We immediately saw a skyrocket in the amount of substances that people were using,"" says Rhianna Kendrick, director of operations for Groundworks.

When he got housed at a hotel in late March he was using less than a bag of heroin a day, but his use has gone up. Despite efforts to stop -- he briefly tried medication-assisted treatment -- he accidentally overdosed twice in July. ""I am not honoring some of the parts of myself that have so much potential,"" Mr. Luoma wrote in a text message that month. Understand the Opioid Crisis During the Pandemic The first months. As Covid-19 brought the U.S. to a standstill, the opioid epidemic took a sharp turn for the worse. More than 40 states recorded increases in opioid-related deaths in the first six months of the pandemic. A reversal of progress. Despite modest gains against addiction -- including a slight dip in deaths in 2018 -- fatal overdoses were rising even before Covid arrived. But the pandemic unquestionably exacerbated the trend. An unprecedented spike. U.S. overdose deaths rose nearly 30 percent in 2020 to 93,000, then the largest single-year increase recorded. Deaths peaked nationally in the spring amid the most severe period of shutdowns. Fueled by fentanyl. The rise in deaths was fueled by increased use of fentanyl, a cheap and readily available drug that is 100 times as powerful as morphine. It is often added surreptitiously as a substitute to other drugs. A grim threshold. Overdose deaths in the U.S. exceeded 100,000 for the first time in the yearlong period ending in April 2021. The figure is more than the death toll of car accidents and guns combined. ""Last night I almost died again,"" he wrote. ""I may have to wait 2-3 weeks to get into rehab. I'm fortunate to have the folks from Groundworks willing to find ways to help me through this waiting period, but the nagging urge, the beast inside that sits waiting for a moment of weakness could kill me before I am able to get in."" Not all drug-related deaths during the pandemic have been from overdoses. Jessie-Mae DeCosta, 32, died from sepsis, an infection she got from injecting drugs. ""Covid kind of sealed Jessie's fate,"" said her mother, LaNell DeCosta, 62, of Bristol, Vt.

The Reil family decided to wait over a month after Mr. Cameron died to hold a service. On a bright and humid afternoon in July, more than 80 friends and family members came together at St. Sylvester's Catholic Cemetery in Barre to mourn him. ""Our hearts break, our heads shake at the injustice of yet another young life extinguished by the disease of addiction,"" Pastor Rachel Fraumann said after beginning her service with a strong warning for mourners to stay as distant from one another as possible. ""I don't want to do a bunch of funerals on the heels of this one."" Tara Reil and her four surviving children sat in white folding chairs with masks, tissues and water bottles handy. Two of Mr. Cameron's brothers had flown in from out of state, taking leave from their posts in the Marine Corps and Navy. Six family members spoke, including Mr. Cameron's stepfather, Terry Reil. ""Let Jef's purpose empower you to make a difference in yours or someone else's life,"" he said, ""to do good things in this world or just let someone you know, know you care about them.""","In the months since the pandemic took hold in the U.S., the opioid epidemic has taken a sharp turn for the worse.

Well,Stopping the Anxiety of HPV,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/well/stopping-the-anxiety-of-hpv.html,"How can women get the emotional support needed after an HPV diagnosis? I was diagnosed over a year ago and since then, I've developed a lot of shame and severe anxiety surrounding sex. Doctors just tell me to use condoms and get regular pap smears, which isn't emotional or comprehensive support.

[Have a question about women's health? Ask Dr. Gunter yourself.]

You are not alone. Many women find a diagnosis of human papillomavirus (HPV) very challenging, and doctors may not always offer the emotional support some patients need. Shame and anxiety can result from a lack of accurate information about the virus or related to the testing involved. Your doctor should be able to provide you with factual information to combat the myths that are weighing you down and do their best to reduce pain and stress associated with any procedures. If needed, they should also be able to refer you to a psychologist to help provide additional support.

Tell Me More

Human papillomavirus is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States: 42 percent of Americans ages 18 to 59 have at least one type of genital HPV. It is slightly more prevalent in men than in women. But unfortunately it is associated with shame and anxiety for some women (as well as men). Some studies show that concerns about sexual transmission contribute significantly to these feelings, but learning how common the virus is can help.

Another source of shame and anxiety is that it is difficult to tell where an HPV infection may have come from. HPV can lie dormant in the body for years before it is seen on a screening. So, the HPV diagnosed today could have been acquired from a current sexual partner or any previous one. Adding to the confusion is that men and women under the age of 21 won't know if they are infectious as they are not routinely screened.",A woman asks about finding emotional support after a diagnosis.,638e2420-38d7-54a1-9547-3128d3225390,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/08/well/08ask-hpv/08ask-hpv-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b32ba1f99b97534575636d51f5314267f8233d315dc61cf56a0a622213afaed4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,HPV infection is associated with shame and anxiety for some women (as well as men).,638e2420-38d7-54a1-9547-3128d3225390,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1638e2420-38d7-54a1-9547-3128d3225390.jpg,18,1
Health,Drug Giants Create Fund to Bolster Struggling Antibiotic Start-Ups,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/health/antibiotics-pharma-drug-resistance.html,"Twenty of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies on Thursday announced the creation of a $1 billion fund to buoy financially strapped biotech start-ups that are developing new antibiotics to treat the mounting number of drug-resistant infections responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. The fund, created in partnership with the World Health Organization and financed by drug behemoths that include Roche, Merck, and Johnson & Johnson, will offer a short-term but desperately needed lifeline for some of the three dozen small antibiotic companies, many of them based in the United States, that have been struggling to draw investment amid a collapsing antibiotics industry. Over the past year, three American antibiotic start-ups with promising drugs have gone bankrupt, and many of the remaining companies are quickly running out of cash. The new AMR Action Fund will make investments in roughly two dozen companies that have already identified a promising drug with the goal of bringing two to four novel antibiotics to the market within a decade, according to the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, an industry trade group that is administering the fund.

Recipients will be chosen by an advisory panel made up of drug company executives, scientists and other experts in the field. The companies will also provide free expertise to biotech companies with promising drugs as they navigate the clinical and regulatory hurdles needed to bring an antimicrobial compound from laboratory to market. ""Antibiotics are the mortar that holds the entire health care system together,"" said David A. Ricks, the chief executive of Eli Lilly, who helped spearhead the effort. ""We make drugs for diabetes, cancer and immunological conditions, but you couldn't treat any of them without effective antibiotics."" In an interview, Mr. Ricks said he was well aware of the irony that Eli Lilly and many of the other companies contributing to the fund were once the giants of antibiotic development but have long since abandoned the field because of their inability to earn money on the drugs. ""We know firsthand how broken the system is,"" he said. The crisis stems from the peculiar economics and biochemical quirks of drugs that kill bacteria and fungi. The more often antimicrobial drugs are used, the more likely they are to lose their efficacy as pathogens survive and mutate. Efforts to promote antibiotic stewardship mean that new drugs are used as a last resort, limiting the ability of companies to earn back the billions of dollars it can take to create a new product. ""It's been a really tough time for companies doing antibiotic discovery despite the tremendous unmet need,"" said Zachary Zimmerman, the chief executive of Forge Therapeutics, a San Diego company that has several new drugs in the pipeline. He said the fund would provide critical help for companies that have already spent millions identifying an innovative compound but lack the money to carry out the costly clinical trials needed to gain regulatory approval. ""A fund like this can really help us get through that valley of death,"" Mr. Zimmerman said.

The collapse of the antibiotic market has dramatically reduced the number of promising drugs. Between 1980 and 2009, the Food and Drug Administration approved 61 new antibiotics for systemic use; over the past decade that number has shrunk to 15, and a third of the companies behind those medicines have since gone belly up. Those backing the fund acknowledge that the effort is largely a stopgap measure. Industry executives and public health experts say that fixing the broken marketplace for antibiotics would require sweeping government intervention to create financial incentives for drug companies, including policy changes that would increase reimbursements for lifesaving drugs kept under lock and key and used only when existing therapies fail. Legislation that would address the problem has not gained traction in recent years. Drug-resistant infections kill 700,000 people a year across the globe, according to the United Nations, which has warned that the death toll could rise to 10 million by 2050 without concerted action. Dr. Peter Beyer, a senior adviser at the W.H.O. who led the effort to create the new fund, said the threat of antimicrobial resistance rivaled that of the coronavirus pandemic, but it was a slow-rolling crisis that could feel abstract to political leaders focused on the next election cycle. ""Hopefully this fund can bridge the gap until politicians realize the urgency of antimicrobial resistance,"" he said. Everly Macario, a public health expert at the University of Chicago Medicine who focuses on antimicrobial resistance, understands how abstract the threat can feel. In 2004, her 18-month- old son, Simon, died from a drug-resistant staph infection within 24 hours of arriving at a hospital emergency room with breathing difficulties. ""People think drug-resistant infections are something that affects other people,"" she said. ""But one day, all of us, both young and old, will need an antibiotic.

Theater,Review: This 'Elephant Room' Sequel Is a Goofball Epic,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/theater/elephant-room-dust-from-the-stars-review.html,"These foundational elements are still present eight years later, as the trio welcome us, their fellow illusionists, to our magic society's monthly meeting. ""I hope you have a ticket for both,"" Dennis told one of the Zoom attendees, who was watching with her cat.

We went through the agenda: minutes; dues; Louie, who appeared to be in a wood-paneled basement, executing a trick with five mugs and a billiard ball, followed by one with ESP cards like those used by Bill Murray in ""Ghostbusters."" The feats of mentalism elicited all-cap messages like ""WHOAH"" and ""STOP IT"" in the chat window -- the Zoom equivalents of gasps.

It's all great fun, but ""Dust From the Stars"" really takes off when it literally takes off.

Directed, like the earlier one, by Paul Lazar, the show deftly mixes the lo-fi aesthetics of budget science fiction (Louie's communication device looks suspiciously like a shower attachment) with dopey humor and experimental theater's sensibility. The last does not come as a surprise: Sobelle is a regular on arty stages, both on his own (""The Object Lesson"" and ""Home"") and with Lyford (""All Wear Bowlers""); Cuiffo is an actual magician who has performed verbatim re-creations of Lenny Bruce's acts. (The sets are by Julian Crouch, whose work has been seen on Broadway and at the Metropolitan Opera.)

After Daryl recounts a nighttime encounter involving flashing lights and mysterious creatures, we switch to a galaxy where Louie ""was volunteered to make first contact."" He disappears and his buddies set out ""to find him in our land buggy that flies and stuff."" At this point, the show starts integrating the actors into elaborate backdrops and videos (the films are credited to Derrick Belcham and Lyford), peaking in an astonishing final scene in which the galactic travelers find themselves in a ghostly locale. It is, like what preceded, very funny, but this time the laughs may catch in your throat.

Your Money,New Tools for Home Buyers as the Pandemic Upends Real Estate,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/your-money/real-estate-relocation-coronavirus.html,"Working from home during the pandemic prompted Dan Feder to consider moving his family to another Los Angeles neighborhood to be closer to his son's school.





Dan Feder, a graphic designer, and his husband, Don Bacigalupi, a museum director, have lived in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles for two years. But they started looking to move closer to their teenage son's school when pandemic lockdowns showed they could avoid a commute across town by working from home. Yet having moved from Chicago two years ago, they still felt that they had an outsider's view of Southern California real estate. They worried, too, about making a mistake in an uncertain economy. ""With so many unknown variables in the world, we wanted as much information as we could get before moving forward with such a large financial decision,"" Mr. Feder said. ""As an outsider, it's difficult to gauge that."" Buying a home under any circumstances can be stressful. But with some buyers looking to improve their lives during the pandemic and others trying to flee congested cities for greater space in the suburbs, the rush to move could cause unexpected problems. Companies are coming up with creative ways to help ease the process.

The financial aspect alone is daunting in this economy. Down payments on a home can be 25 percent to 30 percent of the purchase price, money that becomes largely untouchable once it's handed over. But there are other factors to consider. Carrying costs are one, but so is the nature of a home as an asset: It may be worth millions of dollars on Zillow, but selling it for that price can be difficult. The pandemic has created interrelated dynamics that make the process more complex. Some buyers want out of their city apartments, having already been cooped up in them for months this winter. If they have children, they may be acting quickly to get settled before the school year starts. Existing-home sales in the United States fell 26.6 percent in May from a year earlier, to 3.9 million, according to the National Association of Realtors, but the pandemic has been a catalyst for many to move, with suburban areas drawing more interest, according to a separate report from the Realtor group. For example, the median sale price of a home in New Canaan, Conn., which is within commuting distance of Manhattan, rose 29 percent in May from the year before. The national average interest rate on 30-year fixed mortgages fell below 3 percent for the first time on record this week, which could spur more people to buy a home. There are deals in cities for those with cash and a strong stomach. Some of those purchases, costing millions of dollars, have been made through online scrolling and Zoom walk-throughs. But when purchases are driven by video, what catches the eye sells, and flaws can be missed.

""While various video technologies are changing how we travel and what we need to see live, I would not advise nor endorse buying any real estate sight unseen,"" said Bill Nimmo, who heads the real estate asset management group at Wells Fargo Private Bank. ""It can make sense to put a property under contract before visually seeing it, but not to close on it without seeing it live."" He pointed to the ineffable feeling of home, from the light and flow to the neighbors. ""These are subjective things that most buyers should see and experience to make a major investment,"" Mr. Nimmo said.

The risk of buying anything sight unseen is unavoidable with a project under development. During the stay-at-home order in New York, 10 buyers purchased luxury condos for $2 million to $6 million at an unfinished development, 130 William, in the financial district. Buyers usually get to peruse a high-end show room, to touch finishes and see how kitchens and bathrooms will be laid out. But in this case, they relied on online material, created for each apartment, down to the view from the windows. ""The shutdown worked to our advantage,"" said Scott J. Avram, a senior vice president at Lightstone, the developer of 130 William. ""It turned out to be a good bet to push more advertising. Buyers were almost a captive audience."" Some were persuaded to buy because they could put down a 10 percent deposit, lock in a low-interest mortgage but not have to close until the fall, when the building will be finished.

How people are doing their due diligence in this stressful time is as distinct as this moment in history. Some are trying to do traditional due diligence through new services. This was the case with Mr. Feder. Last year, he fell in love with a neighborhood on the west side of Los Angeles only to watch flames engulf it in last season's wildfires. ""We watched half the neighborhood burn up,"" he said. ""We have a large art collection, and we didn't want to put that at risk."" So in the pandemic, he turned to a new product offered by PURE Insurance called Home Spotlight. The report rates a home's risk for natural disasters like flooding, hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires, and it is meant to show buyers whether PURE would insure the home. Not getting home insurance through a commercial carrier like PURE, AIG or Chubb substantially increases the annual premiums. But the report also details any insurance claims, construction permits and work done on the home that could point to other problems that are not apparent at first glance -- and certainly not through a video tour. ""If the buyers haven't been given full disclosure, which is the law in California, then it causes other questions to come up,"" said Steven Brown, chief executive of Hoffman Brown, an insurance brokerage firm. ""If you didn't tell me about the toilet that overflowed and cost $100,000 to fix, what else didn't you tell us about?"" The report keeps the seller honest; it also slows down a buyer who may be acting quickly without full information.

A different type of fear -- fear of missing out -- is driving buyers who see opportunities as city dwellers flee to the suburbs. Christopher Rim, founder and chief executive of Command Education, an education consultant in New York, said he had started getting unsolicited offers for the TriBeCa loft that he bought less than a year ago. The offers were for more than the $3 million he paid. ""I figured if I could score a deal on another apartment, it would be a good trade,"" he said. He began looking for a bigger condo in a less-desirable neighborhood where prices were cheaper, figuring he would be working from home for the foreseeable future. But when his lowball offer of $3.5 million offer on a condo listed for $4.8 million was accepted, Mr. Rim paused. He worried about getting swept up in the moment. Now his plan is to be more strategic and wait until the fall, when he is betting people who have left the city will discount their apartments even further. ""There's no way school is happening this fall,"" he said. ""They're going to want to offload some inventory."" In addition to viewing real estate, closing on a property has become more complicated and time consuming when social distancing is required. No longer are a dozen people crammed into a law office conference room to watch a buyer sign a stack of legal documents. But remote closings actually require greater vigilance and time to ensure mistakes are not made. ""When you're face to face with a client, you're able to go over all the numbers with them and make sure what they're signing at the closing is what they negotiated,"" said Sal Strazzullo, a real estate and estate planning lawyer at Strazzullo Law. ""Being on the phone with someone and having them sign the documents when you read through them -- you have to step up your game."" He said closings that normally took an hour and a half could stretch on for 48 hours or more. Recently, he had to amend a closing when money wired to buy a condo arrived four days late. Mr. Feder has not found another house in Los Angeles yet, but he and his husband have bought a weekend home in Palm Springs. They used their insurer's home spotlight to assess the renovations that had been done to it.

""It stood out for its cleanliness, but we saw permits that were pulled for work on the home,"" he said. In this case, the renovations were purely for aesthetic reasons, but Mr. Feder felt comfort having the additional background. ""This is a very uncertain age, and there's a part of you that says, 'Are we crazy for making a real estate purchase now?'"" he said. ""But if you can be confident and move forward, that's better.""","As homeowners rethink their surroundings and rush to relocate, companies are offering creative ways to help ease a fraught process.",b77dc198-0ad7-5418-ab2f-91a0c3221ad9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/18/business/18Virus-Wealth-print01/17Wealth-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bea1e61cc861fa03ee57a11a3994e7084fc08f9b188872bc183a64a950107701&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Working from home during the pandemic prompted Dan Feder to consider moving his family to another Los Angeles neighborhood to be closer to his son&rsquo;s school.,b77dc198-0ad7-5418-ab2f-91a0c3221ad9,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1b77dc198-0ad7-5418-ab2f-91a0c3221ad9.jpg,21,7
Television,New on Netflix Canada: The Best Movies and TV Shows for March 2019,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/arts/television/netflix-canada-best-march.html,"Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for March, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. The ordeals of adolescent girlhood have been chronicled many times on screen, but not since Todd Solondz's ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" have they been as acutely registered as they are in Bo Burnham's directorial debut. ""Eighth Grade"" doesn't share the sourness of Solondz's film, however, empathizing strongly with Kayla (Elsie Fisher) as she posts would-be viral videos, throws herself into awkward social situations and rolls her eyes at her overly attentive single father (Josh Hamilton), who doesn't know how to help her. Burnham is particularly smart about integrating social media and messaging into Kayla's story, and showing the ways they reinforce her isolation and desire to connect. In the aftermath of its false Best Picture win against ""Moonlight,"" it's been easy to forget how much momentum and good will Damien Chazelle's throwback musical carried into Oscar night and how big a shock it was that it lost. But one of the benefits of ""La La Land"" not winning Best Picture is that it's no longer freighted by the ""importance"" that goes along with the title. Chazelle's musical pastiche about the Hollywood romance between an actress (Emma Stone) and a jazz pianist (Ryan Gosling) was always meant to be a light evocation of Gene Kelly and Ginger Rogers vehicles, coupled with the bittersweet quality of ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,"" and it's now free to be enjoyed on those terms. The superb character actor Chiwetel Ejiofor makes his directorial debut with this adaptation of the best-selling memoir about a Malawian teenager who takes it upon himself to save his impoverished village. Maxwell Simba stars as William Kamkwamba, a boy who loses his education when his family can no longer afford to send him to school, but who become an autodidact to bring electricity and water to his drought-ravaged area. Using scrap materials and science textbooks, he attempts to construct his own wind turbine. Ejiofor gives himself a key supporting role as Kamkwamba's father, who greets his son's initiative with a mix of pride and practical concern.

Alfre Woodard has been acting in movies and on television for 40 years, and she's as vibrant and appealing as ever in ""Juanita,"" a late-in-life road movie/romance that has been constructed around the title character's range and adventurousness. Adapted from Sheila Williams's novel ""Dancing on the Edge of the Roof,"" the film stars Woodard as a middle-aged woman who follows a one-way Greyhound bus ticket from the Columbus, Ohio, projects to Montana, where she turns around a struggling diner and finds refuge (and love). But on a journey intended to liberate her, she worries about being tied down someplace else. Netflix's most prominent -- and promising -- film release in March brings together J.C. Chandor, the superb director of ""All Is Lost"" and ""A Most Violent Year,"" and Mark Boal, the screenwriter of ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" for the story of an audacious heist that's somewhere between greed and justice. Oscar Isaac, Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Pedro Pascal and Garrett Hedlund star as former Special Forces operatives who attempt to steal millions in cash from a South American drug cartel. The good news for them? The authorities won't care about a cartel getting robbed. The bad news? The cartel definitely will. With ""The Thick of It,"" ""In the Loop"" and ""Veep,"" Armando Iannucci firmly established himself as the most scabrous political satirist of the 21st century, but he goes back to the middle of the 20th for ""The Death of Stalin,"" which digs into the chaos and folly that follow the death of a tyrannical dictator. The operatives surrounding Joseph Stalin in 1953 turn out to be just the sort of inept, backbiting sycophants that populate Iannucci's other comedies. What's different about ""The Death of Stalin,"" beyond its sumptuous period trappings, is how well it captures the fear and paranoia that seized the Soviet Union during Stalin's rule and threw the country into a period of uncertainty after his death. Even by the hard-partying, substance-abusing, hotel-trashing standards of '80s hair-metal outfits, the members of Motley Crue were notoriously rambunctious, turning world tours into grotesque bacchanals that occasionally veered into the dangerous and self-destructive. Their collaborative autobiography, ""The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band,"" is a bracing read that chases stories of shocking indulgence with sobering notes about addiction and a deadly car crash. The Netflix adaptation was directed by Jeff Tremaine, the man responsible for the ""Jackass"" movies, which seems like the perfect match for this material. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" this is not. 'Kubo and the Two Strings'

Starts streaming: March 23 The Portland-based production house Laika has produced some of the most distinctive and sophisticated animated features of the last decade, using a 3-D stop-motion process to add tactility to odd little films like ""Coraline,"" ""ParaNorman"" and ""The Boxtrolls."" Laika's ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" enters the world of ancient Japan, where a boy wielding a lute-like instrument called a samisen tells stories out of dancing origami papers, but whose own life is destined to become the stuff of legend. His quest to stop the evil Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) is notably abstract for a mainstream family film, but it's mitigated by kid-friendly team-ups like a talking monkey (Charlize Theron) and a human-insect hybrid (Matthew McConaughey).

Over 30 years ago, Kevin Costner popped on a period fedora and tracked down the country's most infamous criminals in ""The Untouchables."" He's doing it again in ""The Highwaymen,"" this time as a quick-triggered Texas Ranger who comes out of retirement to catch Bonnie and Clyde. He and an ex-partner, played by Woody Harrelson, are given maximum latitude as special investigators to end a robbery and killing spree that has left 13 cops dead, along with many others. Telling the Bonnie and Clyde story from a lawman's perspective sounds a little square, given the groundbreaking swagger of the 1967 classic starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, but there's something to be said for playing a good story straight. The brilliant Korean genre director Bong Joon Ho (""The Host,"" ""Mother"") made his English-language debut with this futuristic ""Ship of Fools,"" in which the planet has been rendered uninhabitable and what remains of humankind is packed onto a train to nowhere. But the rules of society still apply: The have-nots are relegated to the dingy back cars of the train while the wealthy elite occupy spaces near the front, triggering a class war that threatens to send them off the tracks. Bong's diverse cast of American, British and Korean actors gives ""Snowpiercer"" the right international flavor, but it's Tilda Swinton who dominates as a Margaret Thatcher type who's a merciless enforcer of the status quo. [Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Subscribe to our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.] In December, the eight-episode Netflix documentary series ""Sunderland 'Til I Die"" proved to be a fascinating look at a professional sports team during a serious inflection point in its history, when it was in danger of two straight relegations to lesser leagues. Now Netflix's latest sports-doc series, ""Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"" goes behind the scenes of a more successful franchise, the Mumbai Indians, as it tries to follow a championship year in the Indian Premier League. That's hardly the adversity faced by Sunderland, but in the cricket-crazed city of Mumbai, the pressure to repeat is enormous. The life and death of the Formula One racer Ayrton Senna was the subject of a uniquely compelling documentary, ""Senna,"" told entirely through archival footage of interviews, family videos and hair-raising moments from the racetrack. Now a producer from that film, James Gay-Rees, has returned to the same world with ""Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"" a 10-episode series about the athletes competing for the 2018 F.I.A. Formula One Championship, which starts in Melbourne, Australia, and ends in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Maneuvering lightweight vehicles at 200 m.p.h., the drivers risk their necks every time they turn the ignition, but they are able to check their daredevil impulses through intense focus, discipline and training. Even before discussion of Jeffrey Tambor's alleged abusiveness on set derailed promotional efforts for the first half of its fifth season, ""Arrested Development"" has struggled to find the same absurdist groove of its original Fox run in its Netflix revival, despite enjoying fewer creative restrictions. Yet there's always the lingering hope that Mitchell Hurwitz's comic serial about the life and crimes of the Bluth family could turn things around. ""Season 5B"" pivots around courtroom drama, as Buster (Tony Hale) stands trial for the murder of Lucille 2 (Liza Minnelli).

Idris Elba isn't an actor known for his comic chops, but for a seven-episode run on the fifth season of ""The Office,"" his seriousness and chiseled good looks were turned against him, exposing a well-disguised ineptitude. Created by Elba and Gary Reich, the British comedy series ""Turn Up Charlie"" works a similar dynamic, casting Elba as a hapless DJ and bachelor whose weaknesses are further revealed when he has to play daddy to his famous friend's troublemaking daughter (Frankie Hervey). Elba does some DJ-ing on the side in real life, too, so at least that part of the show will stand to be authentic. In 2012, a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern was gang raped and fatally beaten by six men on a private bus in South Delhi, a crime so horrific that thousands of protesters demanded (and received) legislative action to protect women against rape culture in India. The attack has been dramatized before, poorly, in Deepa Mehta's 2016 docudrama ""Anatomy of Violence,"" but the seven-part series ""Delhi Crime,"" by the Indo-Canadian filmmaker Richie Mehta, was received more warmly out of Sundance. Mehta's series deals with the police effort to investigate the crime, focusing on a female officer (Shefali Shah) with a personal interest in bringing the perpetrators to justice. Also of interest: ""A Monster Calls"" (March 1), ""Dog Days"" (March 1), ""Space Jam"" (March 1), ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (March 1), ""Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj: Volume 2"" (March 3), ""Christopher Robin"" (March 5), ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (March 6), ""Lucy"" (March 6), ""After Life"" (March 8), ""Girl"" (March 15), ""Love, Death & Robots"" (March 15), ""Selling Sunset"" (March 22), ""The Legend of Cocaine Island"" (March 29)","Every month, Netflix Canada adds a batch of movies and TV shows to its library.

# The Kia Sorento will grow larger for 2016, with the South Korean automaker's three-row crossover getting a 3.1-inch-longer wheelbase and a 3.7-inch increase in length. With a higher beltline, lower roof and swept-back styling, the Sorento could challenge competitors like the Chevrolet Traverse, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander, says a report from Automobile Magazine. (Automobile Magazine)

# Although General Motors recently announced that it would modify its trucks' curb weights when reporting payload capacity, the automaker has changed its mind. G.M.'s midsize and half-ton trucks will now be rated using a curb weight that includes heavy optional delete items, like bumpers, which had been removed when calculating curb weights. (Pickuptrucks.com)

# Citing anecdotal evidence provided by its testers, Consumer Reports said that the Tesla Model S it evaluated had ""more than its share of problems."" The publication said that its official reliability analysis of the car is not due until autumn and that testers were generally pleased with most aspects of the car. Consumer Reports said it experienced several problems, including a blank center screen that had to be ""hard reset,"" a defective front trunk latch and a charging adapter that fell apart, noting that Tesla Motors fixed those problems while simultaneously replacing other parts. ""Tesla considers service a top priority, and we err on the side of being proactive to ensure the best driving experience possible,"" the automaker said in a statement Tuesday. (Consumer Reports)

Art & Design,Berkeley Art Museum Names a New Director,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/arts/design/berkeley-art-museum-new-director.html,"The University of California Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive announced on Thursday that Julie Rodrigues Widholm will succeed Lawrence Rinder as the institution's director and chief curator. Her appointment comes at a time when museums across the country are trying to chart a path forward amid an ongoing global health crisis and simmering social unrest.

""I'm really trying to see this moment and all of the challenges we're facing as an opportunity to make the changes that we should have been making and thinking about all along,"" Ms. Widholm, the current director and chief curator of the DePaul Art Museum in Chicago, said in an interview this week.

Prioritizing equity, inclusivity and accessibility has long been her goal. Under Ms. Widholm's direction, the programming at DePaul has consistently highlighted work by women, people who are L.G.B.T.Q. and artists of color. She has also helped to grow the museum's collection and expanded its scope by acquiring pieces by artists from historically marginalized groups. More than 500 new works have been added during her tenure. Most recently, Ms. Widholm started an initiative at DePaul that seeks to help rectify the underrepresentation of Latino artists who live and work in the United States.

Books,"In 'Want,' a Lost Friendship and the Anxieties of the Modern Family",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/books/review/want-lynn-steger-strong.html,"Last winter, when we were all still riding the subways, a friend and I noticed a 20-something couple making out on a downtown train and she asked, ""Remember that?"" But next to the couple was a group of adolescent girls so fiercely in sync with one another -- hugging, talking, laughing -- that they almost missed their stop. ""Remember that?"" I thought, even more wistfully, mourning those early intense friendships that were as close as if not closer than romances -- the ones that you thought were going to last.

So I empathized with Elizabeth, the confessional narrator of ""Want,"" 's moving second novel. Her now severed friendship with Sasha carried them both through high school, college, mental illness and drug addiction -- until it broke, years ago, under all that weight. Left mourning, Elizabeth has taken to cyberstalking Sasha on social media in her free time, which is almost nonexistent. An English literature Ph.D. who, like so many of her peers, could not land a university position, Elizabeth now has two jobs that don't quite equal one salary: teaching by day in a charter high school and at night as an adjunct at her alma mater. Elizabeth also has two little girls, 2 and 4 years old, and a charming husband who hasn't been able to make a living since Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, when he left finance ""to do custom carpentry for the sorts of people that he used to work with."" It hasn't panned out, thus the onus is on Elizabeth to support her family in their Brooklyn one-bedroom, a burden she finds crushing. She hates the school she teaches in, playing hooky as often as she can to read books in cafes and browse art galleries. At home she flees the tedium of runny noses and the anxiety of bankruptcy by taking long, hard runs every morning, and treating herself to movies with the one credit card that still works. She is estranged from her wealthy lawyer parents, who threaten to seek custody of her children, citing Elizabeth and her husband's financial ineptitude. In the midst of these crises, a desperate Elizabeth reaches out to the haunting Sasha, only to discover that her ex-friend's own life has also taken a turn for the worse. Can their long-lost bond save them both now?

As a narrator, Elizabeth is smart and funny and literary to the marrow. The books she inhales for sustenance have turned out to be a great addition to my own pandemic pile. (Thank you, Ms. Strong.) But her tale of woe is in many ways painfully familiar, and ""Want"" often reads like the plotless treadmill diary of a 30-something artist-class white Brooklynite who was born into what she unrealistically thought was a safer, more forgiving world. As I read on, engaged, sympathetic and often frustrated, I found myself in that strange space of feeling deeply for her predicament, yet wanting to shake sense into her: Keep your two lousy jobs and send your husband back to work!","Lynn Steger Strong's new novel follows a Brooklyn wife and mother through professional failure, bankruptcy and the legacy of her past traumas.",0458d47a-a77e-5b74-a0ef-f20bac6776f8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/19/books/review/Schulman1/Schulman1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=e9373a9f5022d197bf799ba10a4329d6c3deeceae1f6706babd6a210361fe229&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Lynn Steger Strong,0458d47a-a77e-5b74-a0ef-f20bac6776f8,Demo_data/D1_imgs/10458d47a-a77e-5b74-a0ef-f20bac6776f8.jpg,13,13
Theater,Anika Noni Rose Was Waiting for This Moment,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/theater/anika-noni-rose-carmen-jones.html,"Way back in 2001, the York Theater Company staged a concert production of ""Carmen Jones."" Anika Noni Rose, then 28, was cast as the angelic ingenue Cindy Lou, who sees the sensuous title character seduce her fiance, Joe. At the time Ms. Rose had only one Broadway credit under her belt, hadn't developed her voice enough to realize she was a soprano, and looked, she said, ""like a 10-year-old."" She knew she was cast as the character she fit best. But the whole time, there in the background, she was wondering: Are you sure you don't want me to be Carmen Jones? Are you sure? ""I don't ever remember not being aware of the show,"" Ms. Rose recalled over a recent lunch at a Union Square hotel. She'd seen the movie version, starring Dorothy Dandridge (""my mother's idol"") many times. And she knew Georges Bizet's opera ""Carmen,"" the source material for Oscar Hammerstein's adaptation, too. Right now it's hard for musical-theater fans not to be aware of Ms. Rose, thanks to her acclaimed performance in that long-dreamed-for title role of the Classic Stage Company production, which runs through Aug. 19.

John Doyle's intimate rendition is the first full New York production of the show since its 1943 Broadway run. In those seven decades, ""Carmen Jones"" went into a sort of obscurity, marked by the very oddity of its essence: it's Hammerstein without Rodgers, and an opera meant for Broadway. In casting Carmen, Mr. Doyle initially thought about actors he'd worked with in his Tony-winning revival of ""The Color Purple."" But when Ms. Rose's representatives called to say she wanted to meet with him, he knew he'd found his star. ""You don't audition people of her caliber,"" he said. ""I knew this was her first time back in a major profile role in a musical in the city,"" he added. ""I also sensed the intelligence with which she leads her life. She waited and made a choice to do something that would presumably stretch her, shine her in a different light, singing in a way people don't expect."" Has Ms. Rose read her reviews, some of the best of her career? She confessed she hadn't. ""I know they're positive but I don't need to know exactly what they say, so don't tell me,"" she answered with a grin.

""Her language is sex -- whether it's being had or not, it's the potential promise of sex, the energy of sexual dalliances past,"" Ms. Rose explained. ""But she doesn't owe Joe one thing. She doesn't even say there will be something for him at the end of that train ride."" Ms. Rose, who was reluctant to talk about her personal life to preserve her family's privacy, grew up in Bloomfield, Conn., deeply influenced by a grandmother who instilled in her a love of history. They regularly read from ""The Black Book,"" Toni Morrison's compilation of events both painful and glorious in the African-American experience. As an actress, she's embodied women who convey both -- from her Tony Award-winning breakout as the daughter of a Southern maid who feels the stirrings of the civil rights movement in the 2004 musical ""Caroline, or Change,"" to her portrayal of the slave Kizzy in the 2016 remake of ""Roots."" She's also played a 1960s pop star in the film adaptation of ""Dreamgirls,"" the president of a historically black university on ""The Quad,"" a ruthless lawyer on ""The Good Wife,"" and an evil kingpin in ""Power"" (a role she thinks her grandmother would have enjoyed). And young fans still look up to her as the voice of Princess Tiana in the animated film ""The Princess and the Frog."" Ms. Rose said she was proud to be part of a project that gave children of color a Disney lead to identify with.

But it wasn't until she saw ""Control""-era Janet Jackson that she felt a deep connection to an entertainment figure, an identification that set her on the path to a theater degree from Florida A&M University, and further studies at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. ""I did all the lip syncing, learned all her moves,"" she said. ""I had a yearning to be a part of things, but I don't think I recognized it as such at the time."" When it had its premiere, ""Carmen Jones"" was among the most ambitious all-black musicals of its time, but it also drew criticism for vernacular language that reinforced stereotypes about African-Americans. Mr. Duncan referred to this ""crudity"" as a product of its time, and like Ms. Rose, he put his confidence in Mr. Doyle. Beyond the language, Ms. Rose thinks people feared reviving the musical because it shows a sexually empowered black woman. It's ""messy, dirty, lush, sweaty and human"" she said.

The show remains a timely reminder of what men expect from women, she added. She described a recent encounter with a stranger who approached her on the street. ""Why are you so close to me?"" she asked. ""I thought we were walking together,"" he replied. She crossed the street as a cab was approaching. ""I could hear anger in his voice as he said, 'Don't get hit by that cab,' like that would be my punishment for running away from him,"" she recalled. Mr. Duncan and Ms. Rose first met four years ago in a workshop of the musical ""Shuffle Along,"" which made its way to Broadway in 2016, but without the actress. (Her only appearances there since ""Caroline, or Change"" have been in revivals of the plays ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" and ""A Raisin in the Sun""; she was Angelica in one ""Hamilton"" workshop, too.)

""I still haven't found who that person was and I still want to, because I thought that's the most punk-ass thing to do to somebody,"" she said. ""It's so ugly, weak and disgusting."" In the final scene in ""Carmen Jones"" when she looks into the eyes of the man who is about to kill her character, she thinks about a pain beyond her own. ""What I want in that time is to allow myself to feel every fear, every hurt, and to let it move through me, and don't let any of that close off -- for all the women who have had to, and will have to,"" she said. There are no plans for ""Carmen Jones"" to continue beyond Classic Stage, and Ms. Rose is thinking about her next challenge, which she hopes will include producing. She pointed to Jordan Peele, Young Jean Lee and Donald Glover as inspiring artists who follow their own instincts. ""I'd like to be able to put my filter on the story, put my lens on it,"" she said. ""Who can I bring along with me? How can I bring women to the forefront? ""How can I show us just living -- just moving through life and growing?"" she added. ""Being knocked over by the wind and picking ourselves up? How many ways can I do that?""","It has taken a while, but playing the sultry title role in ""Carmen Jones"" fulfills a lifelong dream.",aa97f907-2c90-5ed7-afe3-af42321e8769,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/02/arts/02ANIKANONIROSE1/31ANIKANONIROSE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=9cb1614be61a6937234c5122b3522a5eb3fcc5de7e88dbc44081ccb4e500decc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Anika Noni Rose on the World War II-era set of &ldquo;Carmen Jones&rdquo; at Classic Stage Company.,aa97f907-2c90-5ed7-afe3-af42321e8769,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1aa97f907-2c90-5ed7-afe3-af42321e8769.jpg,10,10
Art & Design,Will Global Jitters Dull the Glitter of New York's Art Gigaweek?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/arts/design/fall-art-auctions-contemporary.html,"One of the highlights of the week is Christie's quirky auction Tuesday called ""La Menagerie,"" featuring animal sculptures. It includes this welded hippo by Francois-Xavier Lalanne from 1969 that folds out to reveal a sink, vanity, and full bathtub.





New York's biannual billion-dollar ""gigaweek"" of sales, whose latest series starts on Monday, is the glittering pinnacle of the auction market for Impressionist, modern and contemporary art. But is instability in the wider world taking off some of that shine? The week's various auctions at Christie's, Phillips and Sotheby's (which in June returned to private ownership) are estimated to raise at least $1.2 billion. But the world's wealthy will have to be in a free-spending mood to match the $2 billion raised in May at the equivalent spring sales, when Jeff Koons's stainless steel ""Rabbit"" sculpture fetched $91.1 million, an auction high for any work by a living artist. This time around, there are few museum-quality works by the most famous artists to tempt billionaires -- no painting or sculpture is estimated to sell for more than $45 million. ""First, there isn't a major estate -- this cycle doesn't have a Rockefeller,"" said Diana Wierbicki, global head of art law at Withers Bergman LLP, referring to Christie's 2018 record-setting auction of the Peggy and David Rockefeller collection. Second, she pointed out, sellers and buyers are confronting the global economic uncertainty from a looming Presidential election in the United States, riots in Hong Kong and a Brexit-traumatized Britain. And owners who could sell are thinking twice about offering trophy works at auction because President Trump in 2017 removed art from the assets eligible for 1031 exchanges -- the strategy that allows investors to defer paying capital gains tax on property when it is sold, as long as a similar property is purchased for the same amount. ""Now people are asking, 'Does it make sense to sell if I'm facing a federal capital gains tax of 28 percent?'"" Ms. Wierbicki said.

A report by the French database Artprice that global auction sales were down 17.4 percent in the first half of 2019, as well as the closure in July of Pace gallery's branch in Beijing, have also sobered the mood. Yet there could be a silver lining for buyers with a more modest amount to spend on younger artists and representative pieces by established names. ""For most buyers, there's comfort in a season lacking superlatives,"" said Doug Woodham, managing partner at Art Fiduciary Advisors, based in New York. ""Inexplicable prices can diminish the confidence of some collectors."" This week about 2,050 works will come under the hammer at the three auction houses, the biggest such offering in New York since Nov. 2015, according to data supplied by Artnet . ""These are low risk auctions. There won't be the fireworks we've seen in the past,"" warned Helly Nahmad, a New York gallerist specializing in high-end Impressionist, modern and contemporary art. But Mr. Nahmad said that dealers offering new works had sold well at the recent Frieze London and FIAC art fairs. ""The art market is always one auction away from being on fire,"" he added.

After decades of intense trading, there are few Impressionist and Modern masterpieces still in private hands. Surrealism is one area where collectors and their advisers feel there is still quality and value to be found. (Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, has been an enthusiastic buyer of Magritte). Its conceptual content has also crossover appeal to buyers of contemporary art. ""It's been somewhat overlooked,"" said Suzanne Gyorgy, global head of art advisory and finance at Citi Private Bank in New York. ""We do a lot of work with clients in Asia, and there is real interest in Surrealism there."" At Christie's on Monday night, Rene Magritte's typically enigmatic 1959 canvas, ""Le Sabbat,"" showing a still life painting hanging upside down in an evening landscape, is certain to sell for at least $8 million, thanks to a pre-auction guarantee from Christie's.

Sotheby's and Christie's Impressionism and Modern art sales increasingly rely on outstanding pieces by less well known names. On Tuesday night Sotheby's will be offering the much-exhibited 1884 portrait, ""Richard Gallo et son chien Dick, au Petit Gennevilliers,"" by Gustave Caillebotte, showing a journalist friend of the artist strolling with his black poodle beside a sunlit river Seine. A fringe member of the Impressionist circle, Caillebotte was a gifted painter in a more Realist manner. Never offered at auction before, this particular work has been on loan to the National Gallery in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It is estimated to sell for at least $18 million and has been guaranteed by Sotheby's.

Ever keen to give a fresh twist to its ""20th Century Week"" series, Christie's will hold a day sale of sculpture and design inspired by animals. ""La Menagerie,"" the 31-lot auction, will include this singular welded brass and copper ""Hippopotame I"" which unfolds to reveal a sink, vanity, and full bathtub. it was made by Francois-Xavier Lalanne, husband of the fellow French designer, Claude Lalanne. The quirky creations of ""Les Lalanne,"" melding art and design, have since the 1960s been collected by such influential tastemakers as Gunter Sachs, Yves Saint Laurent, Peter Marino and Tom Ford. Last month at Sotheby's in Paris, the Lalannes' private collection proved a $100 million sellout. Christie's hippo bath, made in 1969, was acquired by its East Coast owner at auction in 2006 for $169,000. It is now estimated at $1 million to $1.5 million.

For many, the one out-and-out trophy of the season is David Hockney's rediscovered acrylic on canvas, ""Sur la Terrasse,"" offered at Christie's Wednesday night postwar and contemporary auction. The $25 million to $45 million estimate makes it the most highly valued lot of the week. (At the time of writing, it hadn't been guaranteed.) The luminous, nine foot high composition, suffused with sunlight and a melancholy sense of a fading relationship, depicts Mr. Hockney's then-lover, Peter Schlesinger, on the balcony of the couple's room at the Hotel La Mamounia in Marrakesh in 1971. They broke up later that year. This little-known work has emerged from an unnamed European private collection and was last exhibited in public in 1973. The $90.3 million achieved at Christie's last November for Mr. Hockney's 1972 ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)"" -- which also featured Mr. Schlesinger -- has encouraged owners to part with major works by Britain's most expensive living artist at auction. ""I knew of its existence, but this is the first time I've seen it,"" said Offer Waterman, a London-based dealer in modern and contemporary art, who in 2015 sold ""Peter on the Balcony,"" a crayon-on-paper study for the latest Hockney trophy. ""Obviously it's a very ambitious painting,"" added Mr. Waterman. ''There's no question it's a great work.""

Earlier on Wednesday, Phillips will hold its day sale of contemporary art, which tends to be the week's clearest indicator of which younger artists are most in demand. It will include a five-foot-high panel painting from 2014 by the Harlem-based artist Derek Fordjour. A nocturne showing two male figures standing at the edge of a circus ring, the painting had been acquired directly from the artist and is estimated to sell for between $50,000 to $70,000. That valuation reflects the $40,000 to $90,000 asked for Mr. Fordjour's latest paintings at a sell-out show at the Josh Lilley gallery in London during Frieze Week. Many buyers are looking to auctions to acquire Mr. Fordjour's works, and resale ""secondary"" market prices are rising steeply. Last month, a 2017 painting sold at Phillips in London for $169,000. ""The auctions reflect where the speculation is,"" said Candace Worth, an art adviser based in New York. ""There is a clutch of younger artists that have become flash points,"" added Ms. Worth, who singled out Mr. Fordjour, Julie Curtiss , Tschabalala Self and Loie Hollowell. Sotheby's 51-lot evening sale of contemporary art contains impressive large-scale abstracts by Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning that are each estimated to raise at least $25 million. The auction also includes a full-length Francis Bacon ""Pope"" painting from about 1958, sold by the Brooklyn Museum in order to ""support museum collections."" The work had been donated to the museum in 1981 by the American businesswoman and collector, Olga H. Knoepke. It is certain to sell for at least $6 million, courtesy of a guarantee from Sotheby's.","A rediscovered David Hockney and a welded hippo are among some 2,000 works coming to auction. But only a handful are trophies.",899f3653-e1f5-5929-a25a-79226fd01b1d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/11/arts/11auction-curtain03/11auction-curtain03-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2f8a991d87b0be34f490fb326e95f6e035ce9d786ade21295fc21e4816888555&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"One of the highlights of the week is Christie's quirky auction Tuesday called ""La Ménagerie,"" featuring animal sculptures.

Fashion & Style,Mary Beard and Her 'Battle Cry' Against Internet Trolling,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/fashion/mary-beard-against-internet-trolling.html,"Mary Beard, silver-haired and red-shod, was seated in front of a packed house at Lincoln Center one recent Thursday morning, addressing an annual conference called the Women in the World Summit. Ms. Beard, a professor at the University of Cambridge and the author of more than 10 books on the classics and classical era, is an authority on ancient Roman culture, but the line that got the biggest response struck a modern (though by no means exclusively modern) note. Ms. Beard was recounting her response to a criticism once lobbed at her in print: not of her scholarship, but of her appearance. A few years ago, in response to one of the television documentaries for which she is well known in England, the (male) critic A. A. Gill wrote in The Sunday Times, in London, that she was less fit for a history program than for ""The Undateables,"" a British reality show for the lovelorn disabled or disfigured. Rather than mutely accept such barbs, Ms. Beard, with good cheer and a professorial drive to correct error wherever it may cross her path, responded in the pages of The Daily Mail with an essay headlined, ""Too Ugly for TV? No, I'm Too Brainy for Men Who Fear Clever Women.""

Time has not mellowed her take. ""When you look at me on the telly, and say she should be on 'The Undateables,'"" she explained, in retelling, to the crowd, ""you are looking at a 59-year-old woman. That is what 59-year-old women who have not had work done look like. Get it?"" (In fact, Ms. Beard was 57 at the time, but the point stands.) This, said Tina Brown, the founder of the Women in the World conference (in which The New York Times is an investor), amounted to a ""battle cry,"" a vindication of one of the rights of woman: to look, even in her 50s, like her unvarnished self. The crowd -- mostly women, for the record -- roared. Whoever else may not have gotten it, they did. As Ms. Beard made her way out of the auditorium and out into the morning, attendees stopped her to thank her. ""You just brought this great spirit,"" one woman said. That spirit is currently applied to a dual purpose. Ms. Beard, now 61, is a classicist of decades-long standing and a ""troll slayer"" (as an admiring profile in The New Yorker called her in 2014) of a few years. She is the author of several books on ancient Rome, including the most recent, ""SPQR,"" a doorstopper history that was a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle Award and a Los Angeles Times Book Prize; the classics editor of The Times Literary Supplement (where she writes a chatty blog); and a regular contributor to both The London and The New York Review of Books.

She maintains her professorship at Cambridge and, in April, was awarded the Bodley Medal, the highest honor given by the Bodleian Libraries of Oxford University. In 2013, she was named to the Order of the British Empire for her services to classical scholarship. But when she began making more-regular TV appearances, on popular documentaries on ancient themes and talking-head political programs, she encountered the response that awaits many women with the temerity to venture into the public arena: ""trolling"" or online abuse. As she did with Mr. Gill's review, she responded, battling back her antagonists and becoming something of a folk hero in the process. Now her engagements often combine her two pursuits, as her talk at Women in the World did: tracing the history of misogyny from the ancient world to today. ""The gloomiest way of describing the ancient world is it is misogyny from A to Z, really,"" she said. But even in the present, she added, ""we have never escaped a certain male cultural desire for women's silence."" The Internet can seem like an echo chamber made to amplify that desire, and in the years since Ms. Beard began taking on her trolls, instances of online harassment against women have continued. (Ms. Beard, now famous for her fight, has largely seen her attackers drop off. But for others on social media, trolling continues, with marquee examples like Gamergate, as well as lower-key, everyday unpleasantness.)

""There's an awful lot about social media which people feel very frustrated about,"" she said. ""It claims to be a democratic online world out there, and yet it isn't."" Misogyny, in her view, is an accessible rhetoric to vent this spleen: ""An available means of being nasty,"" she said, ""of expressing your discontent."" Ms. Beard is unusually good-humored about many of her adversaries. In one much-publicized instance, she not only commandeered an apology, but has kept in touch with her reformed troll, for whom she now writes letters of reference. (""Oh, Oliver!"" she said with apparent affection as his tweets were projected behind her at her conference chat.) She did not, she said, set out to be a hunter of trolls, though she is now often asked to speak on the subject. ""I'm making the best of it,"" she said. Much of the criticism of Ms. Beard has focused, as Mr. Gill's did, on her appearance, and her unusual willingness to be age-appropriate. In fact, and in what may come as a surprise to her detractors, she takes a lively interest in style.

""She has become somebody who I adore,"" Mr. Blahnik said. ""She's one of my favorite people in England. And she's such a '60s girl! She's still faithful to the hairstyle. It's like Jean Shrimpton, and those girls in the King's Road. But the Cambridge version."" She complemented her red shoes for the panel with a canary-yellow coat in a vaguely '60s style -- hardly the ""old frump"" of an earlier era of British academia, though she had no idea who had designed it. (A peek at the label revealed it was by Bitte Kai Rand, a Danish designer.) On modern fashion, she is more an appreciator than an authority, but she is just as comfortable discoursing on pre-Christian shoes as on trolls. ""One Roman emperor, Heliogabalus, never wore the same pair of shoes twice,"" she said, sipping cappuccino at a cafe near Lincoln Center. ""That is just the Imelda Marcos story, isn't it? Then Caligula had slippers with pearls, we imagine, on the soles. He's literally smashing pearls as he walks. Whether any of this true, God only knows, but those are the tabloid versions."" Around this time, two women approached Ms. Beard mid-interview to introduce themselves. They were gun violence prevention activists: Sandy Phillips of Jessi's Message, whose daughter was killed in the Aurora, Colo., theater shooting in 2012, and Donna Dees-Thomases, the founder of the Million Mom March. ""We've been excessively trolled with our work,"" said Ms. Phillips, who had spoken at the conference the night before as part of panel called Mothers Against Gun Violence. ""The same thing that gets said to you gets said to us."" ""I only came to see your presentation today,"" Ms. Dees-Thomases said. ""I've changed my Twitter name many times, and I have a fake Twitter name, too. I tell the trolls to go over there and bother me.""

Ms. Beard has found herself an inspiration to such women, and at a time when trolling seems more widespread, and at ever-higher levels -- all the way to the presidential race. Ms. Brown said this year's Women in the World Summit came after ""such a year of misogyny,"" and called out Donald J. Trump in particular. ""The injection of pure derogatory comments about women throughout has been so ugly,"" she said, ""and the fact that he seems to have liberated the voices of others to agree."" Mr. Trump's name was aired during in Ms. Beard's presentation, and she agreed afterward that there are similarities between Mr. Trump's unfettered commentary and trolling. ""You could make a powerful argument that the kind of tropes in Trump's discourse overlap with the discourse you see in trolling: about women shutting up, about menstruation,"" Ms. Beard said. The issues are serious, and yet her approach remains studied but ever smiling. ""This is exactly what we need more of in American feminism: wry humor,"" Ms. Brown said. ""The outrage meter is getting out of control."" ""It's about talking about it,"" Ms. Beard said. ""It's not being fazed. It's about having a laugh about it. A bit of outrage is good, but having your only rhetorical register as outrage is always going to be unsuccessful. You've got to vary it. Sometimes, some of the things that sexist men do just deserve to be laughed at."" She chuckled and issued a directive at any of her more laughable antagonists. ""Go back home to mummy,"" she said. ""She'll smack your bottom.""",The acclaimed Cambridge classicist takes on everything from Internet stalkers to women's rights.,5cbe20a5-591e-562d-a7cb-a065022ee501,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/17/fashion/17BEARD/17BEARD-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=ae4ee14b169321334fab3d90ffac9098f09d77bc60977050a2dad891855fdd1c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Mary Beard in New York.,5cbe20a5-591e-562d-a7cb-a065022ee501,Demo_data/D1_imgs/15cbe20a5-591e-562d-a7cb-a065022ee501.jpg,19,20
Television,What's on TV Sunday: 'World on Fire' and 'Our Country',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday-world-on-fire-and-our-country.html,"MASTERPIECE: WORLD ON FIRE 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). If you have the appetite for an epic war drama during these tough times, give this new series a try. It centers on several people in five countries navigating life during the first year of World War II. Helen Hunt plays an American journalist; Jonah Hauer-King is a British interpreter working in Poland and Sean Bean (""Game of Thrones"") takes on the role of a pacifist bus driver.

ACM PRESENTS: OUR COUNTRY 8 p.m. on CBS. Last month the Academy of Country Music postponed its annual awards show, planned for April 5, because of the coronavirus outbreak.

Health,UnitedHealth Customers Will See a Discount on Next Month's Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/unitedhealth-coronavirus.html,"With so many of its customers struggling during the pandemic, UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation's largest health insurers whose profits have not suffered during the crisis, is offering modest relief. On Thursday it said it would make $1.5 billion worth of premium credits and fees for doctor's visits available to people enrolled in its plans.

""People are hurting right now,"" said David S. Wichmann, UnitedHealth's chief executive, in a call with reporters on Wednesday night. ""Employers are hurting. Individual consumers are hurting.""

Employers and individuals in its commercial plans could receive credits toward their premium bills for June, ranging from 5 to 20 percent of their May bills. The credits, which would be targeted to those in areas of the country hardest hit by the virus, would not apply to the plans UnitedHealth administers for employers that are self-insured.

For people enrolled in its Medicare Advantage plans, the company said it would waive all cost-sharing for visits to primary-care physicians and specialists through at least the end of September. The company said it wanted to encourage people to get any care they need and had put off during the crisis.","The insurer has seen its earnings rise during the pandemic, so it's awarding premium credits to people enrolled in its plans.",001ae32d-b061-56b8-b217-5162f968d88e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/07/us/politics/07virus-united-health/merlin_171558558_8a4eb500-71f4-462a-823f-3b9ef3ac71c3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=eb1f9e1682180ed1876f1076f0dd0bc376569aab955b4a0ee9d7a75a26ef391f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,UnitedHealth Group has decided to return a part of its profits during the pandemic to enrollees.,001ae32d-b061-56b8-b217-5162f968d88e,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1001ae32d-b061-56b8-b217-5162f968d88e.jpg,1,21
Dance,"Review: 'Trisha Brown: In Plain Site,' on Spring Street",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/arts/dance/review-trisha-brown-in-plain-site-on-spring-street.html,"Trisha Brown, one of the founding figures of postmodern dance in the 1960s, choreographed her last work in 2011. Since then, the dance company that bears her name has found ways to keep her work before the public. In its latest project -- ""Trisha Brown: In Plain Site"" -- the troupe selects items from her multidecade repertory for specific locations; each of these events will be named for its setting.

So the series begins with ""Trisha Brown: In Plain Site, 101 Spring Street, NYC"" on Friday and Saturday; I attended a preview on Thursday. A five-story 1870 cast-iron building, 101 Spring Street is the former home of the artist Donald Judd and today houses the Judd Foundation. Dances were on the ground, second, fourth and fifth floors. This was the kind of new approach to dance that Ms. Brown helped pioneer: dances that the audience had to walk about to observe in different places.

Thursday was a New York idyll, with the huge windows bathing the space with daylight. The dances, however, felt as unlived-in as the building: Everything could have been labeled ""of academic and historical interest."" A long-term believer in the best of Ms. Brown's work, I'm keen to see more ""In Plain Site"" performances, but they need more dance content and juice. Playfulness, texture, fullness were in short supply.

The program consists of five short dances: the solo ""Accumulation"" (1971) on the ground floor; the male duet ""Rogues"" (2011) on the second; two quartets, ""Sticks IV"" (1973) and ""Figure Eight"" (1974), on the fourth floor; and, in the fifth-floor bedroom, a solo from ""M.O."" (1995). Jamie Scott has often been a marvelous dancer (she was one of the last members of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company), but hers was a demure, polite ""Accumulation""; and, though Diane Madden was in the original cast of ""M.O."" 20 years ago, the same applies to the solo she gave from it. The mood, as in the two quartets, was clinical, dry, contained.","Ms. Brown's dance company carries on her work, her name and her approach with a dance series that requires audiences to walk from place to place.",159e1ebd-6024-542f-8d25-98e4f9138b24,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/02/arts/02TRISHA1/02TRISHA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=ee362bbe422ab588354184917bb950c9381248dd14a6d21e356e739daa3d413d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Stuart Shugg, left, and Marc Crousillat of the Trisha Brown Dance Company performing ""Rogues"" at 101 Spring Street, part of ""Trisha Brown: In Plain Site,"" a five-dance program.",159e1ebd-6024-542f-8d25-98e4f9138b24,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1159e1ebd-6024-542f-8d25-98e4f9138b24.jpg,6,6

Music,WNYC Is Dropping 'New Sounds' After 37 Years. Musicians Are Mourning.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/arts/music/wnyc-new-sounds-schaefer.html,"For your expanding ""New York isn't as cool as it used to be"" file: WNYC-FM told its staff this week that it would end ""New Sounds,"" a genre-defying radio program that has played an outsize role in the city's new music scene for nearly four decades. ""Why would they do that?"" Laurie Anderson, the avant-garde composer and musician who was the first artist interviewed on the show when it began back in 1982, said by telephone. The station said in an email sent to its staff on Thursday that it planned to close the program by the end of the year, along with most of its remaining music programming, as it shifts to more news and talk. ""This is a continuation of the momentum that began when we replaced daytime music on WNYC-FM with news/talk format programs in 2002,"" the station said in the email to its staff .

""New Sounds,"" which has been hosted since its beginning by John Schaefer, eked out a distinctive place on the dial with programming that was truly eclectic. It was one of the first, if not the very first, radio program to play Philip Glass's 1984 opera ""Akhnaten,"" which is coming to the Metropolitan Opera this season. It featured the Bang on a Can collective in its early days. (""They were barbarians at the gate, and now two are Pulitzer Prize winners,"" Mr. Schaefer said in a telephone interview.) It drew Brian Eno and the Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan to its studio, and on any given night might feature Balinese gamelan music, country, avant-garde jazz or all of the above. ""What I set out to do was to give a home on the radio to music that was, I guess, homeless -- that didn't fit into any of the neatly defined categories back in the days of the record store,"" Mr. Schaefer said. ""I thought there were lots of people out there like me, who are just curious -- and would like something if you just gave them the chance to hear it."" The show's disappearance comes as radio is changing dramatically, both nationally -- where stations that play classical music and noncommercial genres are being eliminated in many markets -- and locally, where public radio stations have been going through significant upheaval.

WNYC has become a powerhouse in recent decades, but in recent years it has been buffeted by the dismissal of some of its biggest stars, the long-serving hosts Leonard Lopate and Jonathan Schwartz, amid unspecified allegations of inappropriate behavior, which they have denied. This summer New York Public Radio, WNYC's parent organization, announced a new leader: Goli Sheikholeslami, who previously led Chicago Public Media, took over from Laura R. Walker, who had led the organization for nearly 24 years.

The station said in its email to staff that it would ""sunset the New Sounds brand (the radio program and digital stream)"" as well as Soundcheck, another of Mr. Schaefer's shows, which mixed live performances, artist interviews and talk, and which was moved online in 2014. It said that it would also end its Gig Alerts, its weekly music previews, and its Sunday afternoon show devoted to American standards by the end of the year. Its last remaining program featuring what it calls ""playlist music"" will be The Saturday Show, the American-songbook successor to Mr. Schwartz's program, which plays on Saturday nights. When ""New Sounds"" started, radio was still one of the few ways to hear new and offbeat music -- a monopoly it has lost in recent years to the internet, and to streaming services. The station did not disclose its ratings, but said that other factors also played a role in the decision to end the program. ""The decision to sunset New Sounds wasn't fueled solely by ratings,"" Jennifer Houlihan Roussel, a spokeswoman for New York Public Radio, said in an email. ""The WNYC audience is overwhelmingly a news/talk audience, and we are consolidating music to Saturday nights to better serve that listenership."" Still, some artists were aghast. Julia Wolfe, a Pulitzer Prize-winning composer, said that a ""New Sounds"" program about the early days of Bang on a Can, which she helped found, helped them find new listeners at a key moment. ""It was huge, because we were just kids, and we did this crazy thing, and there it was, on the radio,"" she recalled in an interview.

The station said it would work with Mr. Schaefer, who also presents live concert series around the city, to find ""a new home for the New Sounds brand,"" but it was not clear would that would look like. WQXR, New York Public Radio's music station, remains committed to classical music, the station said in its email. On Friday, Mr. Schaefer asked Ms. Anderson, his first guest, if she would also be his last. She agreed.",The eclectic radio program that has influenced New York's music scene since 1982 is going off the air.,cb5dc71d-d25f-5c1a-bb08-15581b6c235f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/arts/11radio1/11radio1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=369&w=705&s=7a3268f4e3dad89f29b368eca6b12ca0f482d1ffd1a1b9ea362e2994ca2ac9a7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"John Schaefer, the longtime host of ""New Sounds"" on WNYC-FM, at Lincoln Center in 2011.

Art & Design,Smithsonian Adds Gallery Honoring Latino-American Culture,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/arts/design/smithsonian-adds-gallery-honoring-latino-american-culture.html,"The Smithsonian Institution announced on Thursday that it will add a gallery dedicated to honoring Latino-American experiences to the National Museum of American History. The addition was made possible by a $10 million lead gift from five members of the Molina family, who made the donation in memory of their father, Dr. C. David Molina, the founder of Molina Healthcare Inc.

The 4,500 square foot Molina Family Latino Gallery is scheduled to open in 2021 and will focus on sharing the stories of Latino communities through multimedia activities, artifacts and first-person narratives. The inaugural exhibition, ""Making Home: Latino Stories of Community and Belonging,"" will explore the history of various Latino cultures in North America and their influence in the United States and elsewhere.

""Latino history is American history, and we have a responsibility to reflect the stories and experiences of Latinas and Latinos in the U.S. today,"" Eduardo Diaz, the director of the Smithsonian Latino Center, said in a statement. ""We'll continue to do that not only through this future gallery, but also through our diverse programmatic, educational and professional development programs.""

Health,"Mitchell L. Gaynor, 59, Dies; Oncologist and Author on Alternative Treatments",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/health/mitchell-l-gaynor-59-manhattan-oncologist-and-advocate-for-alternative-treatments-dies.html,"Dr. Mitchell L. Gaynor, a Manhattan oncologist and popular author who taught cancer patients to supplement conventional medicine with soothing music, diet and meditation -- and practiced what he prescribed -- was found dead on Tuesday at his country home in Hillsdale, N.Y. He was 59. The cause was suicide, said Kevin Skype, senior investigator for the Columbia County sheriff. Further details were not available. Dr. Gaynor, the son of a West Texas dentist, built both a distinguished medical career and a public following. The founder and president of Gaynor Integrative Oncology in Manhattan, he had been a clinical assistant professor at Weill Cornell Medical College, also in Manhattan, and director of medical oncology at the school's Center for Integrative Medicine. He was also the author of six books, many of them focused on the environment's effect on an individual's health and geared for a general readership. They include ""The Healing Power of Sound"" (1999), ""Dr. Gaynor's Cancer Prevention Program"" (1999) and ""Nurture Nature, Nurture Health"" (2005).

In 2013, Jon Regen, a jazz and pop pianist and son of a patient of Dr. Gaynor's, joined with him to produce a record titled ""Change Your Mind."" After it was featured on ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" the record topped Billboard magazine's New Age charts. They recorded two other albums, ""Uplift"" and ""Peaceful Sleep."" Dr. Gaynor, who received a traditional medical education and continued to recommend traditional cancer treatments, was a postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller University in Manhattan in 1987 when he became fascinated by integrative oncology, which encompasses both conventional and alternative treatments -- a hybrid that its detractors call pseudoscience. At the time, research was being conducted at the university into nutrient-gene interactions and the immune system. ""I was amazed at the fact that we really 'are what we eat,' and that with the best medical training in the world, nobody had ever taught me this,"" he said in a 2013 interview. In 1991, Dr. Gaynor was at New York Hospital treating a refugee Tibetan monk named Odsal who was found to have a rare cardiac condition. He concluded that the monk, dislocated from his homeland, ""was literally suffering from a broken heart."" Dr. Gaynor tutored Odsal in his own style of meditation. The monk reciprocated by bringing a traditional Tibetan metal singing bowl to the doctor's Manhattan apartment.

""We removed our shoes and settled ourselves cross-legged on the living room floor,"" Dr. Gaynor wrote in ""The Healing Power of Sound."" ""Odsal took out a small wooden baton and moved it lightly around the rim of the bowl, in much the same way you might trace the lip of a wineglass with your finger."" ""The sound -- a rich, deep note with a strong vibrato that resembled nothing I had ever heard before -- was so exhilarating that tears of joy sprang to my eyes,"" he continued. ""I could feel the vibration physically resonating through my body, touching my core in such a way that I felt in harmony with the universe."" ""I immediately intuited that playing the bowls would change my life,"" he wrote, ""and the lives of many of my patients."" Most of the nutritional supplements and alternative treatments he recommended were aimed at fortifying a patient's immune system and targeted what he determined were the root causes of disease. When people are relaxed as a result of meditation, chanting, listening to music, breathing exercises or other behavioral therapy, Dr. Gaynor said, their heart rates are steady, their breathing is deep and slow and their stress hormones decrease, allowing the immune system to function more efficiently, lowering blood pressure and releasing natural opiates. Dr. Gaynor distinguished between curing a patient -- fixing a physical symptom -- and healing, which he described as a complementary union of mind, body and spirit. ""If somebody had told me when I was a medical student in Dallas, Texas, that one day I would be teaching my patients to use singing bowls to heal themselves, I would have thought he or she was crazy,"" Dr. Gaynor wrote.","Dr. Gaynor, a popular author and the founder of a Manhattan cancer clinic, incorporated music, diet and meditation in his treatments of patients.",55985189-574e-5e3b-8021-5fde81d9a2f5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/20/nyregion/20gaynor-obit/20gaynor-obit-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=b1262bcee302b01da6a404c2f4f2a32758b9df62d7dbd98caf99ce12828465c4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dr. Mitchell Gaynor, with Tibetan singing bowls in a Manhattan office in 2005, advocated natural and traditional medicine.",55985189-574e-5e3b-8021-5fde81d9a2f5,Demo_data/D1_imgs/155985189-574e-5e3b-8021-5fde81d9a2f5.jpg,1,18
Automobiles,"Before Appetizers Are Served, a Quick Diagnosis From the Valet",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/automobiles/before-appetizers-are-served-a-quick-diagnosis-from-the-valet.html,"FIRST IMPRESSION Bruno Cavallini does more than park cars at the Los Angeles restaurant Ink, often providing on-the-spot troubleshooting and minor repairs.

LOS ANGELES -- The ""check engine"" light of the BMW had been glowing for a few days when its owner pulled up to the valet drop-off at Ink, the much-discussed restaurant opened here two years ago by Michael Voltaggio, a ""Top Chef"" reality show winner. The driver was greeted for her lunch first by Bruno Cavallini, 32, whose expertise with cars goes far deeper than what is required by his job with the valet parking company at Ink. When Mr. Cavallini asked how she liked the BMW -- something he almost always does with customers who drive performance cars -- she mentioned the warning light. Mr. Cavallini dug out a hand-held computer code reader from the trunk of his 2004 BMW M3 and plugged it into the diagnostic port of woman's car before driving around to the restaurant's rear lot. When she returned after lunch, Mr. Cavallini explained the problem: her BMW had a bad coolant sensor, and it should cost about $90, not including labor, to fix.

""And don't pay more than $100 for labor,"" he told her. She tipped him $20. The service he provides has not gone unnoticed by the restaurant's owner. ""He is really beyond a valet -- he helps people with their cars, programming the radio, the seat memories and all that,"" Mr. Voltaggio, himself a serious car enthusiast, said in an interview at the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance in March. ""We get from 30 to 50 cars a night,"" Mr. Cavallini said. Estimating that he has probably solved a couple of problems on each shift over the last two years, the total very likely runs to many hundreds by now. The streak started when he programmed the settings to make the automatic tilt-down feature of a door mirror work for a customer who had not yet cracked the code. ""The next day, someone came in with a Mercedes and couldn't figure out how to set the time on the clock, so I showed them,"" he said. ""Then another guy came in with a Mercedes and didn't know why the check engine light was on.""

Mr. Cavallini always brings his laptop computer and a reader for codes in cars' onboard diagnostic system, or OBDII, to his valet job at Ink. As a teenager, Mr. Cavallini began tinkering with his and friends' cars for fun, mostly BMWs. (""They're easier to work on than Audis,"" he said.) ""I used to unsolder the Eproms and flash new coding,"" he said, referring to the process of reprogramming the memory chip in the car's computer. ""I didn't find it to be difficult."" His appetite for shop manuals, which he buys online and reads on his laptop, is nearly insatiable. ""I like to go in deep and spend hours learning the cars; I'm on my computer studying diagrams,"" Mr. Cavallini said. ""A lot of my friends want their BMWs reprogrammed for European specs, like having the side marker lights always on, just to be different. The factory software, at least up to 2009, is in German; I need to learn German."" Mr. Cavallini also studies technical service bulletins and alerts diners to problems that might require attention.

""She didn't have any money,"" he said. ""She came back the next day with a $50 tip."" One night, a woman in a Mercedes-Benz pulled up with a flat tire. ""She is crying -- she's late for a screening of a new movie,"" Mr. Cavallini recalled. So he retrieved the plug kit and air compressor he carries in his car and fixed the leak on the spot, instructing the woman that she needed to get the tire fixed properly the next day. Another customer pulled up in a BMW with one halogen low-beam headlight burned, concerned that the problem would lead to being pulled over by the police. So he swapped in a bulb from his own car -- no charge. He looks out for his customers in other ways, too. He checks every car for operating turn signals and brake lights -- and can often fix them right there. Another time, when a couple who came to dinner in their Jaguar sports car had a few drinks, Mr. Cavallini offered to drive them home and take a taxi back to Ink. All three squeezed into the two-seater. ""If a window regulator is broken, I can't fix it there in the parking lot,"" he said. ""But I can pull the glass up so the customer can lock the car or keep rain out."" Mr. Cavallini's helpfulness also reveals an inner curiosity about technically interesting cars. He's tickled by Mercedes and BMW keyless remotes that close all of the windows simultaneously -- information that he loves to share with owners, few of whom have read the manuals for their expensive cars or been briefed by the sales staff. Mr. Cavallini says he inherited the technician gene from his father, who was a Datsun mechanic in Glendale, Calif.

""My dad taught me the basics -- he knew how to hear if things were right,"" Mr. Cavallini said. He remembers rebuilding a lawn mower when he was in elementary school, and by 12 he was changing clutches. He resurrected a dead Honda 600 car from the early 1970s that year, too: ""I was excited. It finally started after three months, it had little power or compression, but I drove it."" He attended automotive technical school in Southern California when he was a teenager and passed the Automotive Service Excellence test to become a certified mechanic. ""I've been hearing it forever: 'You should open up a garage,' "" Mr. Cavallini said. But he never worked in an auto repair shop. His reason: as someone who loves exotic cars, he has found that owners rarely keep these cars long enough to spend money on them. ""It's hard in L.A.,"" he said. ""People want the greatest and latest."" Instead, he enjoys the benefits of being a valet in a city where the entertainment industry assures that expensive cars abound. ""I have driven a lot of Porsches, a Carrera GT, Speedsters, replicas,"" he said. ""I drove a Bugatti Veyron as soon as they came out. I've driven an Enzo, a McLaren F1."" His favorite car is a 1960s Mercedes SL roadster. (""It's just the smell of leather, the shifter, the big steering wheel, I like that."") He's driven a Lamborghini Aventador, a Diablo VT and a BMW Z8, but there's one car that's eluded him: ""I'm dying to drive a XJ220,"" he said, referring to a rare Jaguar supercar. For now, Mr. Cavallini is happy with his calling. ""If I could have any job in the world, I would drive cars and find what's wrong with them -- and find them a good home."" Mr. Voltaggio sees the benefit of having someone with Mr. Cavallini's knowledge at the restaurant, relating an anecdote about a top Lamborghini executive who dined at Ink recently: ""Michael Lock was here the other night, and Bruno and he were chit-chatting about cars for at least 10 minutes outside. What kind of valet can do that?""","While working as a parking valet at a Los Angeles restaurant, Bruno Cavallini helps troubleshoot, and sometimes fix, problems with customers' cars.",9a156f03-418b-5f08-94a3-afc330ef3f38,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/29/automobiles/VALET/VALET-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=589f5302313817f48a8d6c74ca4c87f2dfa003efeed6e9c985d3e324c2d7b050&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"FIRST IMPRESSION  Bruno Cavallini does more than park cars at the Los Angeles restaurant Ink, often providing on-the-spot troubleshooting and minor repairs.",9a156f03-418b-5f08-94a3-afc330ef3f38,Demo_data/D1_imgs/19a156f03-418b-5f08-94a3-afc330ef3f38.jpg,23,23

Too Young for the Job

After a series of disappointing results in the Democratic primaries, Elizabeth Warren announced the end of her presidential campaign on Thursday.

""In spite of her experience, her track record and her skills in the debates, American voters ultimately decided she just didn't have what they were looking for in a president, which is a penis."" -- JIMMY KIMMEL ""Yeah, after a lot of thought and reflection, Warren realized she was overqualified for the job."" -- JIMMY FALLON ""Yeah, apparently, America isn't ready to have a president who's only 70."" -- CONAN O'BRIEN ""Honestly, I can't say I blame Elizabeth Warren for dropping out.

Food,"The Shortcut to Crisp, Tender Pie Crust",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/dining/grated-pie-crust.html,"When I first started to grate and press out short-crust pastry, rather than roll it, I'd show up to any breakfast or birthday with a pie in hand. I'd lurk near my dessert so I could read lips after people took their bites. ""She's a chef,"" they'd say, to explain my dangerously tender, crisp crust.

I discovered the technique in the first professional kitchen I worked in, where I was charged with making the restaurant's classic lemon tart. Terror that mine would be more ""bake sale"" than ""Michelin star"" was replaced by confidence and a baking obsession when I learned the simple secret behind their perfect pie. It's rare that a shortcut actually makes food better, and this one does.

I've subsequently renounced flakiness, crimped edges and latticed lids in favor of grated crusts just thick enough to cradle wobbly curds, and tender enough that they crumble when I try to eat a slice like a piece of pizza, without a plate.

And I still feel the glow when my pie crust is praised -- no longer at the suggestion that I've mastered the advanced skill of rolling out pastry perfectly , but rather, because I haven't. For this reason I consider a box grater to be the great pie equalizer. Anyone can trade in the stress of ""forming a disk,"" of searching for a wine bottle to use as a rolling pin, of transferring torn pastry to its dish for this easy route to perfection.","Once the chef Clare de Boer learned the grating trick, she never went back to rolling.",1c5c5ef6-c1f9-5792-8197-3e19a44df673,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/dining/15pie1/merlin_164213547_a35b5fea-f18c-42bd-bd2e-1636c1654eac-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b454eaa677a7d9139c6d31f1e9cf4bb8c7e52d43c7ca2b9ff9da342a0336d445&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, three pies made with buttery, crisp shortcut pie crust: hazelnut, pear and cardamom tart; walnut and molasses pie; and a British bakewell tart with cranberry sauce.",1c5c5ef6-c1f9-5792-8197-3e19a44df673,Demo_data/D1_imgs/11c5c5ef6-c1f9-5792-8197-3e19a44df673.jpg,17,17
Television,'A Suitable Boy' Finally Finds Its Perfect Match: Mira Nair,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/arts/television/suitable-boy-mira-nair.html,"When ""A Suitable Boy"" was published in 1993, the 1,349-page tome about post-Independence India, written by Vikram Seth, became one of the longest English-language novels in print. Superlative reviews around the world ensured its place in the door-stopping canon of modern literary classics. For many devoted readers, the book, set in the 1950s and featuring multiple interreligious friendships and relationships, has endured because of its myriad relatable family dramas and also for being a kind of guide to what it means to be a secular, independent citizen. Now, after several stalled attempts, the beloved novel has been adapted into a lavish new six-part series, directed by the Oscar-nominated filmmaker Mira Nair (""Salaam Bombay!,"" ""Monsoon Wedding""). When it debuted on BBC One in July, it was lauded in Britain as the network's first prime-time drama filmed on location in India with an almost entirely Indian cast. In India, the reaction was more complicated: Members of the ruling Hindu nationalist party have called for a boycott over its depictions of interfaith romance, and the police opened an investigation into Netflix, which distributes the show there. In the United States, where ""A Suitable Boy"" debuted Monday on the streaming service Acorn TV, the series arrives a bit more quietly, but boycott-free.

""The main reason I wanted to do it was to make a mirror to the world that we were farther and farther away from,"" Nair said in a recent video call from her home. ""The '50s has always been a real pull for me -- 1951 was the year my parents got married,"" she added. ""It was a secular time and a time of real idealism, taking from the English what we had known, but making it our own."" The novel ""A Suitable Boy"" emerged as Hindu nationalist politics began to take center stage in India following violent clashes over the destruction, in 1992, of a 16th-century mosque in Ayodhya. Seth set the novel in the aftermath of the violent 1947 division of India by the British along religious lines, which created Pakistan. But his approach was to pen a dramatic comedy of manners, spinning a prickly mother's attempts at Indian matchmaking into a sprawling and heartfelt saga of four upper-class families, star-crossed lovers, religious coexistence and post-Partition politics. It became the definitive novelization of India's founding years.

After several failed attempts to have the book adapted, Seth personally chose the Welsh screenwriter Andrew Davies for the job, fresh off a successful 2016 BBC adaptation of another historical epic, Tolstoy's ""War and Peace."" As Seth continued to work on his long-gestating sequel to the novel, he entrusted his sister, Aradhana Seth, to ensure the integrity of the adaptation. (She is credited as both a producer and an executive producer.) The BBC commissioned the series in 2017; Nair, who had expressed interest from the beginning, was brought on the next year. Humorous comparisons aside, the ""Suitable"" adaptation, though similar in both soapiness and sweep to ""The Crown,"" had nothing like the budget devoted to the House of Windsor drama, one of the most expensive shows on TV. In order to afford the locations and period detail both Nair and Vikram Seth wanted, the production was trimmed from eight episodes to six and condensed the book's serpentine narrative. ""Every time you see something that's being adapted, you have to go in with fresh eyes and leave the book outside the viewing room,"" Aradhana Seth said.

Rather than spread the attention among the novel's many central characters, the TV version focuses primarily on two young protagonists, Lata and Maan (Tanya Maniktala and Ishaan Khatter), who are coming into adulthood as India prepares for its first post-independence elections, held in 1952. While Maan aids in his father's election campaign in the countryside, opening his eyes to the wider politics of caste and religion, Lata learns what it means to find her own way despite her mother's comedic insistence on finding her a suitable Hindu boy. ""There is so much energy to Lata,"" Maniktala said. ""She's fresh out of her university; she's yet to explore the world. She lives in a bubble where, according to her, everything will be great.""

Filming was completed in India last December and Nair took a break in March from editing the show in London with a visit home to New York. Then international borders closed because of the coronavirus. In the video interview, Nair demonstrated how she toggled between multiple screens to edit with her team across the world. Even the music was scored remotely, with a full orchestra in Budapest and her composers, Alex Heffes and the sitarist Anoushka Shankar, in Los Angeles and London. When the show premiered in Britain, it was widely praised in the mainstream press as a milestone in representation on the BBC. South Asian critics were less kind, focusing on the mannered English dialogue and overly enunciated accents, with particular focus on why an 84-year-old Welsh writer had adapted this iconic story about the birth of modern India and a young woman's romantic awakening. As social media criticism built, Vikram Seth broke his public silence to defend his choice of Davies, saying ""race should have nothing to do with it"" in The Telegraph. ""It's a balance between getting someone very, very Indian to write it or someone very, very experienced at adapting long books,"" Davies explained from his home in the British Midlands. (His other TV adaptations include ""Bleak House"" and ""Pride and Prejudice."") ""I feel a little prickly and needing to defend my territory and not have it taken away from me as a writer. I would claim the right to put myself in the mind of people who are different from me."" Nair, who was raised in a secular Hindu family, pushed to return more of the novel's political themes back into the screenplay. ""Politics was front and center for me, and that was one of the biggest things that I could do was to re-shift the balance of the story,"" she said. ""Less from 'will she or won't she marry' -- 'Pride and Prejudice' and Mrs. Bennet, that trope -- to really making Lata feel like the making of India.""

Nair also set out to integrate as much spoken Hindi and Urdu into the screenplay as allowable within the strictures of BBC broadcasting. Asked about balancing the twin demands of her unapologetic brown gaze and prestige British television, she laughed. ""It was a charming tussle, can I say."" It's a familiar challenge for Nair. A seasoned veteran of the sometimes bruising battles for more truthful and artful representations of South Asians on Western screens, she has made several acclaimed films about India and its diaspora. ""She tends to pick topics that reflect ongoing social issues grounded in everyday realities,"" said Amardeep Singh, a professor of English at Lehigh University, in Pennsylvania, who wrote the book ""The Films of Mira Nair: Diaspora Verite."" ""With her attempt to take on the changes occurring in modern India, 'A Suitable Boy' fits very nicely into an arc that includes films like 'Monsoon Wedding' and 'Salaam Bombay!'."" The series was filmed on location amid the ""grandeur and the decay"" of real cities, as Nair described it, where production designers labored to hide the electrified chaos of modern life to achieve the show's layered, midcentury Indian minimalism. An appropriated mansion in Lucknow, in northern India, was refashioned into the salon of a Muslim singer and courtesan named Saeeda Bai. Her home is the luminescent force at the center of Nair's adaptation, the embodiment of an aristocratic Islamic court culture and literary sensuality that was in decline by the time the story begins.

Maniktala teared up over the phone as she reflected on her own grandfather's trauma as a Hindu refugee forced by the 1947 partition to flee to India from what is today Pakistan. ""I realize how important pain is, and the lessons"" to be found in that, she said. ""The kind of empathy people had -- I feel the humanity aspect has been on the decline,"" she continued. ""We have to remember where we came from. We can never forget.""","The filmmaker's acclaimed and controversial adaptation of the landmark novel, the BBC's first prime-time drama with an almost entirely Indian cast, comes to American TV this week.",c4854afe-b12a-54aa-9748-38300fa61f76,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/09/arts/06SUITABLE3/06SUITABLE3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,"""Mira is very particular about how her women are shown onscreen,"" said the actress Tabu (pictured with Ishaan Khatter) of Mira Nair, the director of ""A Suitable Boy"" on Acorn TV.",c4854afe-b12a-54aa-9748-38300fa61f76,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1c4854afe-b12a-54aa-9748-38300fa61f76.jpg,3,13
Television,9 Times Big Bird Helped Us Be Better People,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/arts/television/big-bird-caroll-spinney.html,"Who among us didn't learn something from Caroll Spinney's Big Bird over the years? Spinney, who for decades brought the Gentle Giant to life (and also Oscar the Grouch), died on Sunday, but the lessons he shared live on with the millions of people who grew up watching ""Sesame Street."" Beyond alphabet recitals and numerical countdowns, everybody's favorite feathered friend had valuable things to say to both children and grown-ups about the value of cooperation and the best ways to navigate complex emotions. Life can be tough, he told us, but it's going to be all right. Here are a few of the tricky topics Big Bird broke down for viewers young and old.

Flightless Big Bird felt insecure about himself after reading about ""another bird"" -- the pioneering aviator Admiral Richard E. Byrd, who was the first to fly to the South Pole and back. What could Big Bird possibly do that might compare? ""All I ever do is just sit here and play jacks and eat birdseed. And I'm never the first anywhere."" Diana Ross helped boost Big Bird's confidence during her Season 13 guest spot when she sang ""Believe in Yourself,"" advising him to swap ""I can"" for ""I can't.""

Big Bird always encouraged kids to eat the fruits and vegetables they're often eager to avoid. In Season 29, he shopped at the Union Square farmers market and visited an upstate farm called Blooming Hill, where he marveled at all the fresh produce. Big Bird also teamed up with a pair of First Ladies to promote healthy eating -- Hillary Clinton in Season 25 and Michelle Obama in Season 40. ""Broccoli! Yum, yum, yum, yum,"" Big Bird said, making dinner time a tad easier for parents around the country. As part of the ""Eat Brighter"" campaign, Big Bird teamed with Obama and Billy Eichner on an odd (but Emmy-nominated) segment of ""Billy on the Street,"" where they played a grocery store game called ""Ariana Grande or Eating a Carrot?"" (As in, which is better? Answer: the carrot, of course.)

For the very young, healthy eating can mean breastfeeding, which Big Bird did a lot to help normalize. When the cast member Buffy Sainte-Marie welcomed her son Dakota to the show, it gave her a chance to teach Big Bird how to deal with his jealousy that the baby was receiving more attention than he did, and to explain different kinds of love. (""Different People, Different Ways."") She also demonstrated that nursing her infant was perfectly natural. ""See, he's drinking milk from my breast,"" she told the curious bird. ""Lots of mothers feed their babies this way. Not all mothers, but lots of mothers do."" Out in the real world, everyday moms were still being humiliated and shamed for nursing in public, so it meant a lot for Big Bird to see and accept it back in 1977. ""You know, that's nice,"" he said. (In 2012, thousands of parents petitioned for ""Sesame Street"" to feature more breastfeeding.)

Big Bird had a tough time getting grown-ups to believe him. They dismissed his super-reclusive pal Mr. Snuffleupagus as an imaginary friend -- or maybe even an elaborate lie. And after 14 seasons, Big Bird's insistence otherwise was beginning to call his general credibility into question. One grown-up did believe his stories -- Mister Rogers, during a crossover episode in Season 12. But was it too late? Even Mr. Snuffleupagus was a skeptic, doubting Big Bird several times. (""Et tu, Snuffy?"" Big Bird moaned). It all made Big Bird question his ability to distinguish fantasy from reality. Finally, though, inspired by a string of high-profile (but ultimately problematic) child sex abuse cases, ""Sesame Street"" allowed Big Bird to rally support for his claims in Season 16 and prove them in Season 17 -- showing kids that grown-ups would believe them when they actually did tell the truth. Big Bird always enjoyed friendly competition, but was never sure if he should be happy when he won if someone else had to lose. After a footrace with Mr. Snuffleupagus, for example, he said, ""He's going to be sad he didn't win, and he might even be angry because I beat him."" (Fortunately, Mister Rogers was still on hand, and helped Big Bird realize that he could be a gracious winner and still let his friend know that he cared about his feelings.) Many years later, Big Bird competed against Jason Schwartzman on ""Lip Sync Battle,"" and when he won the round, asked the host LL Cool J to make it a tie. ""I know you said that you can't have two winners, there could only be one, but couldn't just this once, couldn't we change the rules?""

Big Bird had his share of minor accidents -- that's the point of ""Everybody Makes Mistakes."" But in Season 32, over the course of five episodes, Big Bird had to deal with the wreckage of his nest by a hurricane. (""My home, my nest, my everything!"") The grown-ups pitch in to restore his modest digs -- a process only made possible through friendship and cooperation. When the job is done, Big Bird is deeply grateful for all their help and tells them so (""I Want to Thank You for Being My Friends""). The lesson: Disasters will sometimes happen, but possessions are replaceable -- people are not. Big Bird is no stranger to nightmares, and he suffered a big one during a sleepover with Gabi in Season 27. But he also got a fright when Gabi hid under the blanket and was making ""Wubba wubba"" noises -- a sound usually uttered by ""Sesame Street"" monsters. When he realized that it was only Gabi, Big Bird asked her to do it again, ""because sometimes it's fun to be scared.""

When the actor Will Lee, who played the grocer Mr. Hooper, died in 1982, ""Sesame Street"" was unsure how to deal with his loss. Should the story line have his character retire to Florida? Instead, his absence became a lesson for Big Bird -- and the children watching -- about understanding death and dealing with grief. After consulting with child psychologists, the show decided on a direct approach, and the result was the first ""Sesame Street"" episode to treat a difficult topic in a profound but age-appropriate way. Big Bird had to process an array of conflicting feelings -- shock, confusion, frustration, regret, anger. Big Bird's portrait of Mr. Hooper still hangs on the wall, even though an art dealer offered to buy it in a later episode. Out in the real world, Big Bird expressed his grief over the death of the Muppet master Jim Henson by singing at his memorial service, a moving way to send off his very best friend.","Caroll Spinney, who portrayed Big Bird for decades, died on Sunday.

Theater,Review: On the Road With Mom in 'Miss You Like Hell',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/theater/miss-you-like-hell-review-public-theater.html,"This is a fresh take on the American road story, filled with people and ideas we rarely get to see onstage. And if, from the start, it's clear where the ride is headed -- through encounters and adventures to accommodation and rapprochement -- Ms. Hudes still makes room for a surprise conclusion that widens the perspective and encompasses great loss. Let's just say the trip doesn't end in Los Angeles.

But along the way, ""Miss You Like Hell"" too often falls short of its own ambitions. In its eagerness to spotlight the women's present-day lives, it leaves Beatriz's back story seriously underdeveloped. We never learn what she does to get by -- she may be an artist or a welder or both -- or what really happened with Olivia's father. That he doesn't appear seems fair enough, but that he is vilified in absentia opens up questions the text isn't prepared to answer.

At other times it answers questions that didn't need to be asked. Though some of the women's adventures are pertinent to the theme -- for an undocumented immigrant, a minor traffic stop quite naturally becomes an existential problem -- too much time is turned over to diversions apparently meant to be distracting or, worse, heartwarming.

So in Skokie, Ill., mother and daughter meet a retired gay couple (Michael Mulheren and David Patrick Kelly) who are partway through their project of getting married in all 50 states. Neither the show nor the actors seem comfortable with this cute, inorganic story line. And a side trip to Yellowstone National Park, where one of Olivia's blog followers is a junior ranger, is the kind of scene that is justified only by the authors' needs, not by the characters'.

It's probably no coincidence that the musical numbers arising from these detours fall flat. Ms. McKeown, a folk-rock artist who borrows liberally from many genres, has produced a full AM-FM spectrum of contextual styles, but for the most part they lack the structural underpinnings that let musical theater songs do the heavy work asked of them. The lyrics are too often wet and purple, with mushy off rhymes that are particularly problematic in up-tempo numbers (like the gay couple's ""My Bell's Been Rung"") that need the snap of precision.

Ms. Rubin-Vega, with her rough charisma, and Ms. Jimenez, with her youthful loveliness and blue-sky voice, generally make you forget all that. I'm a bit surprised, though, that a production directed by Lear deBessonet requires such forgetting. Ms. deBessonet, the creator of the marvelous Public Works series and the director of a bubbly production of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" at the Delacorte last summer, is usually expert at keeping tonal balance. Here she leans into rather than minimizes a tone that is often thick and even mawkish, a problem exacerbated by a physical production (by the set designer Riccardo Hernandez) that feels harshly minimal and -- until a powerful, on-the-nose gesture at the end -- too vague.

It may be that ""Miss You Like Hell,"" which evolved from Ms. Hudes's 2009 drama ""26 Miles"" and had its premiere as a musical at the La Jolla Playhouse in 2016, just needs more time. Certainly events have caught up with (and in some ways outrun) its tear-jerking story, which is pre-emptively set in 2014, before the Trump presidency. But you can't set the audience in 2014; when an officer wearing an ICE uniform appears onstage, everyone knows what nightmare is coming.

Of course, part of Ms. Hudes's plan is to make us understand that people like Beatriz -- whose lives have been spent, as one smart lyric has it, looking over their shoulders -- always did. The rest of us are just catching up.",A new musical at the Public Theater reinvents the family road trip narrative as a mother-daughter tale of immigration policy gone astray.,5ff76d6a-30bf-57aa-8bfc-d8f1afeabc1a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/11/arts/11missyoulikehell-1/11missyoulikehell-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=a5f9733867d3ecfdb91216ae7462121eb5044fc6b157dcd1dca1e041328ac505&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gizel Jim&eacute;nez, left, and Daphne Rubin-Vega play a daughter and mother whose relationship has been distorted by immigration policies.",5ff76d6a-30bf-57aa-8bfc-d8f1afeabc1a,Demo_data/D1_imgs/15ff76d6a-30bf-57aa-8bfc-d8f1afeabc1a.jpg,10,10
Style,Work Songs of the Cowboy Poets,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/style/cowboy-poets-elko-nevada.html,"ELKO, Nev. -- It's bright in Elko. The light is raw Nevada light. It pierces the eyes: Here, wide-brimmed hats are as much practical attire as they are fashion statements. The sun is a fact. The surrounding hills are grass beige and winter sagebrush gray-green, with pale white drifts of snow in the lee of ridges. The austere reds, pinks and grays of coyote willow line the banks of the Humboldt River. Along Idaho Street, the combination of fine Great Basin dust and winter's road salt collects on the sidewalk. It's a still day -- the storm comes in tonight -- so the dust and salt gather in pockets along the curb instead of whirling around in middle of the street. The roadside grass is tawny and damp, pocked with cottonwood leaves and little pools of snowmelt. There's the steady rumble of truck traffic, both commercial and private. Some trucks bear the logos of Major Percussive and American Drilling Corp. It's one of those occasional windless days in this desert city, a hub of mining and ranching (and gambling and prostitution) in northeastern Nevada. In the moments when the traffic subsides, it's quiet, in that all-encompassing way the Great Basin is quiet. The air moves over ravens' wings. The grackles chirp and warble in the bare trees overhead.

 Their home base is the Pioneer Saloon, on the ground floor of the old Pioneer Hotel, which today stands as the Western Folklife Center. The bar is full of Wranglers, Stetsons, handlebar mustaches, wool, silver-work and leather. Some cowboys wear the weather on their faces. Everyone has silk wild rags tied around their necks. A few younger men and women wearing new boots and clean ponchos wander in with guitars and cases in hand, smiling, looking a bit tentative. Most of the people here appear to be in their 60s and 70s. Most are white. Everybody's drinking something; a few are drinking water. The poets have come not only to practice a tradition born of work and regional identity, but to expand the idea of this ever-changing place. As the historian Richard White once wrote, ""The mythic West imagined by Americans has shaped the West of history just as the West of history has helped create the West Americans have imagined."" It's a chance to adapt an old story.

Dan Thurston, from Elko, in a short-sleeve plaid shirt and a bolo tie, recites a poem called ""Fire."" His story of being caught in a brush fire with only a watering hose evinces a connection to landscape, community and the changing fire ecology of the Intermountain West that can be hard to see from far away, even from Reno. Many of the poets have been here before. Amy Hale Auker , who writes both poems and essays, first came to Elko in 2003, when her son was invited to perform. ""The cowboy poetry and music world became my family of heart,"" Ms. Auker says, ""as well as a window for me into what other people living a rural life were creating."" She began performing later, around 2010.

Gail Steiger, her husband and a singer-songwriter, has come to Elko since 1988, when the Western Folklife Center dedicated that year's gathering to his grandfather, Gail I. Gardner. ""I shot a video of him singing his best-known song,"" Mr. Steiger says, ""'Tying Knots in the Devil's Tail.' We screened it during the keynote address. I'd heard him sing the song thousands of times growing up but was shocked to see many people in the audience singing along with the video. I had no idea the song had gotten around as far as it apparently had."" This makes Mr. Steiger a veteran of the weeklong event, which began, officially, in 1984, and unofficially, much earlier. There's dispute about this in Elko.

Olivia Romo, a poet and water rights activist from Santa Fe, spoke about the need to hear more of those of these rural voices. ""I think the only way we can engage more writers of color who have authentic connections to the land and a rich tradition in the West is creating opportunities for them to share their work and stories. Going to them! Listen to the indigenous land-based people in the West who are resilient, reclaiming their languages and songs, but most importantly ready to share and be brought to the table."" She mentioned Geno Delafose, Henry Real Bird, Tish Hinojosa and Ofelia Zepeda as some of the poets and musicians who have been embraced in Elko. Ms. Romo first attended the gathering in 2017 to screen her poem-film about the acequias, the traditional community water resources of New Mexico, for the Moving Rural Verse Project. In one of the afternoon readings she read poems that speak to a hybrid mythology of the West. One invokes Tlaloc, the Aztec rain god; another creates a new myth in which the roadrunner is a prophet. ""The drought has been my entire lifetime,"" Ms. Romo says. She uses the rhythms and speech patterns of spoken word poetry in a strong mixture of Spanish and English, to speak of familial ties and heritage. ""Chaquegue,"" a poem named for the blue corn mush that is central to New Mexican cuisine, makes food a metaphor for tradition, linking her father's corn harvest with the traditions of New Mexican Chicano culture, highlighting water fights between rural communities and big western cities. These fights are everywhere and will only increase as climate change and population growth collide.

How much longer do you want to be in the wind? his poem begins. A plane overhead interrupts his reading, and he stops, clearing his throat. I reached in the roar of the water for a feeling in the wind ... He continues, as the air fills with the roar of an airplane. He stops. ""We can do that again, as soon as he leaves ..."" The plane flies out of earshot. Mr. Real Bird begins again: How much longer do you want to be in the wind?

The poem, ""Indecision,"" is a tour de force of absolute presence. As he speaks, the vowels crash together, and the words change speeds, echoing the jazz inflections of beat poetry and evoking synesthesia. ""You can hear the stars in the wind,"" he says. The words swoop over and under one another. ""I reached in the roar of the water for a feeling in the wind."" The word ""water"" has been on everyone's lips, and here it is, some of that precious desert water, heading toward the Humboldt Sink, 200 miles west of here. Mr. Real Bird ends his recitation. ""That's how that one goes,"" he says, and the dusk goes pink all around.","Ranchers and seekers of the ""mythic West"" travel each year to a small Nevada city to practice a tradition born of labor and regional identity.",993aaf79-c915-56e0-9387-26431202cb27,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/10/fashion/10THELOOK2/merlin_151256574_8343e124-bd2d-492e-b631-632962e6f6b3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=35abe9ad92ef0af941f1a333d7834edb0a7d644ce171dce8d56fd9fe4bba6ea0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, now in its 35th year, draws thousands of ranch workers and Western enthusiasts to this small city.",993aaf79-c915-56e0-9387-26431202cb27,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1993aaf79-c915-56e0-9387-26431202cb27.jpg,15,13
Opinion,The Snake-Oil Salesmen of the Senate,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/opinion/hydroxychloroquine-covid.html,"Dr. Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, testified at a Senate hearing last week about hydroxychloroquine.







There was a super-spreader event last week in the United States Senate. It wasn't the coronavirus, however, that was spreading, but misinformation. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing about early treatment for Covid-19. Yet instead of a robust discussion about promising emerging therapies or what Congress might do to accelerate such treatments, the conversation was all about the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. That's right. Almost nine months into the pandemic, during a surge, with 1,500 daily deaths, senators saw fit to rehash a medical dead end. Trial after trial has found no evidence that hydroxychloroquine improves outcomes for Covid-19 patients; some studies have found that it causes more harm than good. The hearing and the theater around it are a window into the disinformation campaigns that have hobbled our national response to the crisis and undermined belief in science.

The purpose of congressional hearings is to inform policy with evidence and analysis from expert witnesses. For those of us whose life's work is the production and evaluation of data, participation is a highlight -- a chance to help shape the national debate. But this hearing, at which I testified, was different. Neither Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican senator who is the chairman of the committee, nor his chosen witnesses -- three doctors who have pushed hydroxychloroquine -- displayed more than a passing interest in evidence. Intuition and the personal experiences of individual doctors were acclaimed as guiding principles. The history of medicine is littered with snake-oil salesmen who championed useless or harmful treatments based on personal experience. Early in the pandemic, President Trump referred to hydroxychloroquine as a ""game changer,"" declaring himself ""a big fan."" Asked why he was so enthusiastic about it, Mr. Trump said, ""I feel good about it."" That's not how we practice medicine, and unfortunately, his feelings turned out to be wrong. In the hearing, I was called ""reckless"" because I pointed to facts that could prevent people from getting this treatment. The evidence itself, they seemed to be arguing, was the misinformation. Our fundamental disagreement was about whether we can trust science. Senator Johnson and his witnesses questioned the integrity of the medical community, suggesting scientists were part of some ""deep state"" conspiracy to deny Americans access to lifesaving therapies. We've heard this before -- including from President Trump, who has accused doctors of inflating Covid-19 cases for profit.

The hearing encapsulated the competing narratives of the pandemic. On one side was a group of people essentially arguing that the coronavirus was no problem because we had a cheap and easily available therapy. On the other side, I argued that the pandemic is hard, that we have few easy solutions, and that we have to work constantly to protect lives through public health measures while we await widespread vaccinations. It's easy to see which narrative is more appealing. The hearing was amplified by right-wing bloggers and social media celebrities, who accused Democrats and me (I was summoned to testify by the committee's Democratic ranking member) of being responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths. People called for me to be fired and brought to justice. It was a powerful reminder that not even Congress is immune to toxic conspiracy theories about doctors being in cahoots with government regulators to deny Americans lifesaving therapies. By elevating witnesses who sound smart but endorse unfounded therapies, we risk jeopardizing a century's work of medical progress. Do we really want to go back to valuing anecdote over data, and no longer use the best evidence to decide which treatments work? Or perhaps worse, do we want to let politicians prescribe our medications? Whether you believe hydroxychloroquine is a miracle drug for Covid-19 should not depend on who you vote for. Science is the tool we use to know what is true. It is the foundation of modern medicine and public health. We can disagree in good faith about policy trade-offs, what we value, and how best to achieve certain goals. But science and evidence are the bedrock for that debate. The creeping partisan polarization of knowledge itself endangers all of us. Ashish Jha (@ashishkjha) is the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.

Technology,"Twitter, Facebook, Slack: Using Every Tool to Hear What Readers Think",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/personaltech/tech-engage-readers.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Hanna Ingber, editorial director of The Times's Reader Center, discussed the tech she's using. The Reader Center collects story ideas and feedback on our coverage from readers. What have been the most important tech tools for engaging with our audience? We use a variety of tools to listen to our readers and respond to them. We need that variety because readers are talking about our coverage on so many different platforms -- our own site, Twitter, Facebook and more. Plus, there are readers contacting us directly by email and phone. We even received a letter in the mail -- which I promptly Instagrammed.

Twitter can be very useful for quickly knowing how readers are reacting to our coverage, but it's also very noisy. The social media dashboard Tweetdeck makes a big difference. I set up columns that help me sort through the high volume of tweets and find the ones that are most important to me. For example, I have a column that shows me every time a tweet mentioning The New York Times is getting a lot of attention.

Facebook is also crucial to our work. We can use it to get feedback on our coverage and reach out to our readers, asking them about the news or their communities. One of my colleagues on the Reader Center, Josie Sedgwick, wanted to know what the long winters are like for our readers who live around the Arctic Circle. She put together a series of questions using an in-house tool called Formacist, and then posted that on Facebook, targeting readers who live in countries in that region. She was hoping to hear from maybe a dozen readers; she heard from 700. (And their responses were breathtaking.) Facebook Live enables us to have candid and accessible back-and-forth discussions between our journalists and our audience. A recent thought-provoking example was a Race/NYT chat with hosts John Eligon and Rachel Swarns discussing adoptions that cross racial and ethnic lines. We also use email, and the comments system on our site. Plus, our colleagues send us interesting or useful feedback they spot through our Reader Center Slack group.

Many of our colleagues wish they had a better sense of what our readers are saying about their coverage. There is a lot of feedback to keep up with and sort through. We'd love to have a tool that would enable us to aggregate reader feedback (emails, social media posts, comments and more) in a faster and more systematic way. You've invested time in coming up with creative ways to use social media. What are some of your favorite uses of social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat or Instagram? I appreciate Twitter when reporters bring us along on a journey, telling a story with their tweets. Rukmini Callimachi, our correspondent who covers Islamist extremism, took her followers along as she traveled with an embed into western Mosul, for example, introducing us to villagers and showing us what she saw. When Julie Turkewitz, a national correspondent, traveled with a group of students from Parkland, Fla., to the state capital to demand more gun control, she tweeted scenes from the bus along the way. Her tweets were gripping and immediate, and they gave us a window into a scene we couldn't have otherwise gotten. Twitter is also an indispensable tool for journalists and just about anyone else to be part of a conversation about the news as it's unfolding.

While journalists are on Twitter, the bulk of our readers are on Facebook. At The Times, we regularly use Facebook to reach our readers and ask them to participate in our coverage. I also prefer Facebook for its sense of community. Facebook groups tend to be closed, so people are writing posts to a segment of people. Perhaps because the posts are not for the wider public, there seems to be a lot less posturing on Facebook than on Twitter. Do you have a personal favorite Facebook group? My guilty pleasure is scrolling through the Maplewood Moms* Facebook group. (I live in a neighboring New Jersey town.) Local parents post questions that are incredibly relevant to my life, like how to get your toddler to brush his teeth. There are discussions on managing a commute and bedtimes, and horror stories of lactation rooms that don't lock. Even though I don't know all of the mothers, or even most of them, I feel a sense of shared values and experiences. We can so easily relate to one another, battling toddler meltdowns and long waits at the pediatrician's office. And this leads to an online environment that feels both intimate and supportive. What other tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life? I tried the Apple Watch and could barely figure it out. So I'll say my phone (an iPhone 7 with a maroon and purple case).

My entire life exists on my phone. For nonwork purposes, I love that I have a camera and video recorder with me wherever I am -- crucial for a parent of young children. I do my banking, listen to podcasts, read, and jot down funny things my 4-year-old, Isaac, says. And I wrote out these answers on my phone (in the Notes app) while getting my hair cut. Smartphones now also make for easy house stalking. I love going to a dinner party and then checking out the person's home on Zillow. My husband and I often play a game to guess how much we think the house sold for. (Life in the suburbs is underrated.) In our own home, our kids love using our Amazon Echo. Isaac asks it all sorts of important life questions (like ""Alexa, do you like bubbles?""). He also orders up his favorite songs, then he and his little brother dance around the kitchen. I wish there were a feature on my phone that could make it quickly obvious to others what I am doing on it. I grew up watching my parents read the newspaper over breakfast. I wish that when I was reading the news, my kids could tell. Instead, they just see my head in my phone. That is the major reason I still get the Sunday paper.","Hanna Ingber, editorial director of The Times Reader Center, provided a how-to on using social media to converse with readers on topics from race to the weather.",204137b7-54b9-5e65-a9e0-becb408b976d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/05/business/05techusing-1/05techusing-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=27ea38f56db00a8f3b5d9057984c32c3fefab6fea2c2859700b58c98574d7fad&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Hanna Ingber, editorial director of The New York Times Reader Center.",204137b7-54b9-5e65-a9e0-becb408b976d,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1204137b7-54b9-5e65-a9e0-becb408b976d.jpg,20,20
Food,New Liqueurs Adopt the Buzz of Coffee Culture,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/dining/drinks/cold-brew-coffee-liqueur.html,"Coffee has been cool for years now. Coffee liqueur, not so much.

Your relative might have a bottle of Tia Maria on hand around the holidays, and Kahlua is indispensable should you hold a ""Big Lebowski""-themed party. (The main character, the Dude, favors White Russians.) But to discerning drinkers, such liqueurs have a reputation as sweet and syrupy, something best left to the Mudslide fanciers of the world.

A few new coffee-flavored liquors have come on the market recently, though you'll have to squint to find the word ""coffee"" on the label. It's there, but far easier to spot are the words ""cold brew"" -- one of the most embraced terms in modern coffee culture.

Sports,"U.F.C. 249, Skirting Coronavirus Limits, Is Set for Tribal Land in California",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/sports/ufc-249-coronavirus-location.html,"The Ultimate Fighting Championship plans to hold a pay-per-view event on tribal land in Central California this month, an attempted end run around widespread federal and state guidelines against holding large gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic, according to three people familiar with the decision. Even as most sporting events have ground to a halt worldwide because of the highly contagious virus, Dana White, the U.F.C. president, has insisted he can safely hold mixed martial arts events without fans in attendance. ""This place where this fight is going to be on April 18 I have locked up for two months, so I'm going to continue to pump fights out,"" White told ESPN on Monday, though he declined to say exactly where. The location will be the Tachi Palace Casino Resort near Lemoore, Calif., about 40 miles south of Fresno, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because White had not announced the venue. The casino, which closed the night of March 20 because of the pandemic, is on land belonging to the Tachi-Yokut Tribe, part of the federally recognized Santa Rosa Indian Community.

A representative of the Tachi Palace Casino Resort could not immediately be reached for comment, and the U.F.C. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The location was first reported by Jeff Sherwood, the co-host of the ""Behind the Pay Wall"" M.M.A. podcast. The U.F.C. postponed three events in March and April as stay-at-home orders became increasingly widespread and states began requiring nonessential workers to stay home. Nevada, where the U.F.C. is based, is under a statewide stay-at-home order until at least April 30 -- it has even shut down the Las Vegas casino industry. The Association of Ringside Physicians, which represents safety personnel in combat sports, has urged the suspension of all combat sports. ""Any combat sport taking place during this global pandemic places the athletes, officials, and anyone else involved in the event under unnecessary risk of infection and transmission of Covid-19,"" the association said in a statement. ""In addition, combat sports athletes often require medical attention after a bout, and we do not wish to see any additional strain on an already overwhelmed medical system."" By holding the event on tribal land, the U.F.C. is not subject to California's executive order mandating that people stay at home. The fights on the card also do not need to be sanctioned by the California State Athletic Commission, which normally regulates mixed martial arts events in the state. The commission has canceled all fights through May 31.

""The commission echoes the guidance of California Governor Gavin Newsom, the Department of Public Health, local health officials, and the recommendations of the Association of Ringside Physicians regarding the cancellation of events where people may be at risk of contracting Covid-19 and encourages the industry to do the same,"" the California athletic commission said in a statement. ""The commission will not participate in the U.F.C. event on April 18, regardless of the event location."" U.F.C. 249 was originally scheduled to be held on April 18 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, and to be headlined by a lightweight championship bout between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson -- one of the U.F.C.'s most anticipated matchups in years. But after Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York restricted mass gatherings and the New York State Athletic Commission announced it wouldn't authorize the event, White said the U.F.C. would go forward at a different location. On Monday, White said that Nurmagomedov, now at home in Dagestan, Russia, was out of the fight and would be replaced by Justin Gaethje in the interim lightweight title matchup. Nurmagomedov and Ferguson have been scheduled to fight each other five times since 2015, but each plan fell apart because of injury, illness and now the pandemic. To book any fights involving athletes who cannot travel to the United States, White has said he secured an island but has not disclosed where. Though the U.F.C. produces all of its own events, the April 18 pay-per-view event will be sold by ESPN+, ESPN's streaming service, and the preliminary card will be scheduled for one of ESPN's cable channels. An ESPN spokeswoman declined to comment on Tuesday. Tribal casinos, including the Tachi Palace Casino Resort, regularly host mixed martial arts and boxing matches with the full support and participation of state athletic commissions. World Extreme Cagefighting, a mixed martial arts company founded in 2001, held most of its first two dozen events at the Tachi Palace Casino Resort. It was purchased in 2006 by Zuffa, then the parent entity of the U.F.C., and merged with the U.F.C. in 2010. But tribal casinos also sometimes host mixed martial arts events that cannot be sanctioned elsewhere, a form of venue shopping that most state athletic commissions view unfavorably.",The move for a card that includes a highly anticipated fight involving Tony Ferguson is an end run around state regulators and nationwide public health guidelines.,ea7e2641-a5c4-5d27-87d4-3ecdb8192969,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/sports/07ufc01/07ufc01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=8e2266831f74c7da66a0d15103c93ded8eec560d77067a0784da51a582156139&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"U.F.C. intends to hold its next pay-per-view event on tribal land in Central California, making an end run around state and federal regulation and public health guidance.",ea7e2641-a5c4-5d27-87d4-3ecdb8192969,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1ea7e2641-a5c4-5d27-87d4-3ecdb8192969.jpg,9,20
Music,The Met Opera's 'Dutchman' Sails Into Port With a New Star,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/arts/music/flying-dutchman-met-opera.html,"The bass-baritone Evgeny Nikitin was a late replacement for Bryn Terfel in the title role of Wagner's ""Der Fliegende Hollander"" (""The Flying Dutchman"") at the Metropolitan Opera.Credit...Julieta Cervantes for The New York Times

Its director, Francois Girard, is becoming the company's go-to for Wagner, with ""Lohengrin"" to come.

The bass-baritone Evgeny Nikitin was a late replacement for Bryn Terfel in the title role of Wagner's ""Der Fliegende Hollander"" (""The Flying Dutchman"") at the Metropolitan Opera.

At a rehearsal one recent afternoon, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra was roaring out the final scene of Wagner's ""Der Fliegende Hollander"" (""The Flying Dutchman""), which opens on Monday, the first new Met production of the work in over 30 years. A man's shadow, projected onto a screen at the back of the stage, stood several stories high behind the action. Watching it, it was hard not to think of another giant looming over this production, even in absentia: the commanding Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel, who had been scheduled to return to the Met for the first time in eight years to sing the title role in Wagner's early, torrid Romantic masterpiece. Then, late in January, while appearing as the Dutchman in Spain, Mr. Terfel fell and fractured his ankle. ""Unfortunately I've been around long enough that I'm used to calls like that,"" Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, recalled with a rueful chuckle.

Mr. Terfel must have some variant of the Dutchman's curse, which in the opera has condemned the character to roam the oceans forever, allowed to leave his ship only once every seven years to try and break the spell. ""He was supposed to sing in the new production of 'Tosca' a couple of years ago,"" Mr. Gelb said. ""Then he arrived to rehearse and couldn't perform. So he felt terrible that, once again, something beyond his control kept him from being here.""

The Met eventually found, in Evgeny Nikitin, an experienced replacement. He extricated himself from some engagements in Russia with the help of Valery Gergiev, who is conducting the new production and wields considerable clout in their homeland. Mr. Nikitin joins the soprano Anja Kampe, who plays Senta, a young woman who has grown obsessed with the Dutchman legend, practically worshiping a portrait of him that hangs in her father's house. She fantasizes about breaking the curse, and -- spoiler alert -- eventually sacrifices herself to save his soul. (A man's redemption through the love of a faithful woman is a favorite Wagnerian theme.)

Ms. Kampe has had a sterling career in Europe for two decades, but is only now making her Met debut. The company had offered her roles in the past, she said in an interview after running the score with Mr. Gergiev in a basement rehearsal studio, ""but I wanted to wait for the right thing."" If this ""Dutchman"" -- a co-production with Dutch National Opera, the Abu Dhabi Festival and Opera de Quebec, which premiered it last summer -- isn't the right thing, it's hard to know what would be. The director, Francois Girard, has directed only a single opera at the Met, a vivid, sensitive version of Wagner's ""Parsifal"" that was introduced here in 2013 and revived in 2018, but was one of the most acclaimed stagings of Mr. Gelb's 14-year tenure.

""'Parsifal' is set in a world of unreality and we tried to pull it back to reality,"" Mr. Girard said, sitting in the theater after rehearsal. ""Except for the Dutchman and his ghosts, this is the opposite. We've removed it from the ground zero of reality. Which helps the piece. When you play it too realistically, you expose its simplicity or naivete.""

In other words, the more stylized the action -- the more it seems to take place inside Senta's fevered imagination -- the more muted its antiquated gender dynamics. For Mr. Girard, the most challengingly misogynistic aspect of the piece is that Daland, Senta's father, agrees to trade his daughter for some gold the Dutchman is carrying, a troublingly mercenary transaction. In the new production, though, the Dutchman and his sailors have wandered the cosmos, arriving not with gold but with glowing rocks that, for Mr. Girard, represent ""cosmic power, cosmic knowledge.""

The set completes the Met's iconic golden proscenium with a matching lower lip, giving the staging the impression of taking place within Senta's painting, or perhaps even within her mind. That recurring, looming shadow of a man is actually created in real time by a dancer backstage wearing a motion-capture suit, a way of representing the Dutchman's supernatural nature without falling into what Mr. Girard called ""the skeleton cliches."" (Think the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies.) Mr. Girard began his career as a film director (""Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould,"" ""The Red Violin""), but when he began to work in live performance, he was at first reluctant to incorporate film into his stagings. He's gradually shrugged off that reticence, and the ""Dutchman"" overture introduces a heady mixture of painted elements, video and dance that continues throughout the intermissionless performance:  Questions remain, and not just about how Mr. Nikitin will live up to the expectations of many in the audience who were eagerly anticipating Mr. Terfel. While Mr. Gergiev has done much Wagner, at the Met and elsewhere, his performances are notoriously uneven: sometimes inspired, sometimes phoned-in.

And the Met's lead singers are worried -- as, to be fair, singers often are -- about being heard, given that the staging tends to place them high and upstage. ""It's a pity we are so behind, for the sound,"" said Ms. Kampe, who has the charming habit of repeating words in triplicate when she wants to make a point. ""It's high up, and back, back, back. It's all open. In the back we have some fabric and no wood; it goes up, up, up."" About Mr. Girard's sensible symbolism and visual flair, however, no one takes serious issue. With the hit ""Parsifal"" under his belt and now a second Wagner opera, with a third to come -- ""Lohengrin,"" currently in development for a future Met season -- he is swiftly becoming the company's go-to director for this challenging but rewarding composer.

Movies,4 Film Series to Catch in N.Y.C. This Weekend,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/movies/nyc-this-weekend-film-series.html,"[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]

FRITZ LANG'S INDIAN EPIC 'THE TIGER OF ESCHNAPUR' AND 'THE INDIAN TOMB' at Film Forum (Sept. 27-Oct. 3). A sweeping adventure filled with tigers, snakes, romance and the camp-connoisseur favorite Debra Paget, these two movies marked Lang's return to German film production after more than two decades in Hollywood, although both were shot and set in India. Released in the United States in 1960 as a condensed 92-minute version, the films are showing here as separate features, which means that more than three hours of expressionistic color and wild plot developments await.

NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL at Film at Lincoln Center (Sept. 27-Oct. 13). The world premiere of Martin Scorsese's ""The Irishman"" and other main-slate screenings may nab the headlines, but you can spend the entirety of this festival at the sidebar programs and come away sated -- not least because this year's revivals include a 25th-anniversary restoration of Bela Tarr's ""Satantango"" (on Sunday), a film that runs seven and a half hours. For the festival's 57th edition, the big retrospective celebrates the 100th anniversary of the American Society of Cinematographers. In the first week, the members represented include the innovative Chinese-American cinematographer James Wong Howe, with ""The Hard Way"" (on Saturday), a melodrama in which Ida Lupino refuses to let anyone impede her sister's rising stage career, and the film noir master John Alton, with the Los Angeles police procedural ""He Walked by Night"" (on Tuesday). In the annual Spotlight on Documentary lineup, Sergei Loznitsa offers a sardonic found-footage look at the pageantry surrounding Statlin's death in ""State Funeral"" (on Saturday and Sunday), while in ""Free Time"" (also on Saturday and Sunday), the city symphonist Manny Kirchheimer makes a cine-collage out of scenes of downtime in New York shot from 1958 to 1960, adding a gently off-kilter sound design of classical music, jazz and imperfectly synced noise.

Sports,"As Australian Open Begins, Pollution From Fires Is in Play",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/19/sports/tennis/australian-open-fires.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian Open, site of epic jet lag and searing heat, has long been a struggle against the elements as much as a tussle against the opponent across the net. Scheduled in the Australian summer, the Open is where the former champion Ivan Lendl donned a Legionnaire's cap to combat the sun and where the ball boys and ball girls still wear them. During my first visit, in 1993, Jim Courier defeated Stefan Edberg in a torrid men's final, and when the photographers returned to the press room, there was an acrid smell. That was because for some of them, the soles of their shoes had started to melt on the court.

But this year has brought a different threat: smoke from the bushfires that have devastated some of Australia this summer, destroying property and leaving at least 25 people and millions of animals dead. ""A tragedy for Australia,"" Novak Djokovic, the seven-time Australian Open men's singles champion, said on Sunday. ""It's really not pleasant to see this many people suffer the consequences of a big force that is hard to stop. At times, nature shows us how, in a way, insignificant we are towards her."" Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams and some of the game's other leading figures combined forces on Thursday for an exhibition at Melbourne Park that helped raise more than $3.5 million for bushfire relief. Some players have donated prize money. Some are making donations for each ace or, in the case of the Swiss star Belinda Bencic, for each double fault (she doesn't hit many aces).

Players have repeatedly made the point that their tennis problems pale in comparison with the more elemental issues. After Williams won the singles title in Auckland, New Zealand, this month -- her first title in nearly three years -- she donated her prize money of about $43,000 to bushfire relief. On Monday, she defeated 18-year-old Anastasia Potapova, 6-0, 6-3, in her opening match at the Australian Open. ""It's important for people like me who have a big platform to raise awareness,"" said Williams, who has been coming to Melbourne since 1998. ""For me in particular as a player, it was incredibly devastating because I literally know people who have been affected."" Nick Kyrgios, the Australian men's star, said: ""If you get down to it, people are losing their families and homes. It's not easy to just completely switch your concentration on the Australian Open -- 'How is your forehand going today?' -- when you put it in perspective."" But after a number of players complained or suffered because of poor air quality during qualifying last week, there were concerns about a repeat during the tournament itself, which began on Monday and will run for two weeks. ""If it does get bad, I can't imagine going out there and everyone going out there and playing three out of five sets,"" said Denis Shapovalov, a Canadian seeded 13th in the tournament. ""You get warnings from the news telling people to stay inside, that it's not good for your health to be outside, to be breathing this stuff, and then you get an email from the tournament saying that it's playable and you guys have to go out there and put your life in jeopardy, put your health in jeopardy. ""You see the effects on players it has right now, the last couple days, but you don't know what it's going to do later in our lives, and how it could affect us if we're breathing this air in for two weeks,"" he said. The prospect of two such weeks is unlikely. The air quality in Melbourne has improved markedly in recent days, and though it is dependent in part on wind direction, the air quality forecast for the early stages of the tournament is promising. On Monday, the tournament even got heavy rain, which postponed matches on outside courts by midafternoon. The retractable roofs were closed in the three main arenas, where play continued.

The Australian Open decided that play would be automatically suspended outdoors if the levels of microscopic particulate pollution, called PM2.5, exceeded a threshold of 200 micrograms per cubic meter. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the upper limit of the hazardous form of pollution for air quality to be considered ""good"" is 12 micrograms per cubic meter over 24 hours. In California last year, when thick smoke from the Camp Fire rolled across the Bay Area, the particulate pollution hit nearly 200 micrograms per cubic meter. The tiny particles are hazardous, and the threshold used by the Australian Open is within what the E.P.A. defines as a ""very unhealthy"" range, when people are advised to limit outdoor activity. ""They are so small they can get right down into the lungs and into the bloodstream and can cause longer-term effects,"" said Kate Charlesworth, a public health physician based in Sydney. When PM2.5 levels are between 97 and 200, play at the Australian Open may continue but under the tournament referee's discretion based on medical input. Under 97, play will most likely continue. According to data released by Tennis Australia, the readings during qualifying play on Tuesday peaked at 165 at 11 a.m. and then dropped off. On Monday, shortly after play began, the Australian Open's on-site reading was a practically perfect 2. ""I know it was tough last Tuesday, Wednesday,"" said the American Sam Querrey, who won his first round on Monday, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, over Borna Coric. ""I don't have an opinion on whether they should have played or not. I know it's been all over the media. But if you flew here right now you wouldn't know there were fires in Melbourne. It's fine. They've done a good job now with that air quality system. They've got TVs in the locker room with live feeds of the number so you can look every three, four minutes so you're not just taking their word for it. It was a 1 when I walked out there, which feels like glacier Alaska weather."" Craig Tiley, the Australian Open tournament director, said: ""Many sports have 300 and higher as hazardous, but will continue below 300 and make a judgment call within that range. We chose 200."" Charlesworth said research on the harmful effects of air pollution typically studied cases of long-term exposure in heavily polluted cities. She said the effects of short-term exposure in a city like Melbourne were much less clear.

Petra Kvitova, a women's singles finalist here last year, is asthmatic and said she had been relieved to see the improvement in air quality in Melbourne. ""I do have my medicines here, as well,"" said Kvitova, who said she was ""very comfortable"" with the approach the tournament had taken. But the problems and lack of detailed communication during the early stages of qualifying have shaken the confidence of some other competitors. ""There isn't trust,"" said Vasek Pospisil, a member of the ATP player council. ""Because the air quality is expected to be fine now, I don't think it will really matter at this point. But I think it would get interesting if a similar situation came up."" Tiley attended the ATP player meeting on Friday to explain the tournament's actions, saying that air quality was ""a very complex and confusing issue"" in part because there are many different types of measurements available.",Organizers of the year's first Grand Slam tournament say they will suspend play outdoors if pollution levels become too hazardous.,ba450cfe-6116-5abf-ba8c-b9c0ecab045c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/19/sports/19tennis-fires-1/merlin_167167269_fbda2fe4-6316-408a-934e-49dc8e2d25f6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a9f0a2b0f6b390de6b04d01452f012be349d7226dd28cd49c09432e7edacb0ec&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Haze from the country's bushfires hovered last week over Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, the main venue for the Australian Open.

Opinion,"Seriously, Just Wear Your Mask",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/opinion/coronavirus-masks.html,"Seriously, just wear one. Almost any mask will do, really. N95, surgical, spandex, homespun cotton. For people who aren't front-line health care workers, what matters is whatever you can get your hands on that fits over your nose and mouth. As the nation plunges for a second time into the depths of this brutal pandemic, officials worry we'll soon have as many as 100,000 new cases every day. Summer won't save us. Neither will bluster or bleach. It's easy to want to give up, but it would be wrong. Wearing a mask is not only simple and cheap, it's also proved to be effective in slowing the virus's spread. It will protect the health and even save the lives of your loved ones, your neighbors and people you don't know. This isn't hard. If the lower half of your face is not covered when you go out in public, stop searching for excuses and go mask up.

Or think about it as the best path to economic recovery. If all Americans were required to wear masks in public, we could reduce the number of daily cases to a level that would otherwise require lockdowns that would slash nearly 5 percent, or $1 trillion, from the nation's gross domestic product, according to an analysis released this week by Goldman Sachs. Or, if you like, think about it as a gesture of patriotism as we mark a stark and somber Independence Day. But please, just don't think about it as so many Republicans do. ""Mask-wearing has become a totem, a secular religious symbol,"" Alex Castellanos, a longtime Republican strategist, told The Washington Post. ""Christians wear crosses, Muslims wear a hijab, and members of the Church of Secular Science bow to the Gods of Data by wearing a mask as their symbol, demonstrating that they are the elite; smarter, more rational, and morally superior to everyone else.""

This is a bizarre way to talk about people who are guided by facts, science and reason. It's not about making a political point or asserting moral superiority; it's about saving lives and protecting one another -- which should be a basic element of citizenship in any democracy. And yet, like so many seemingly nonpolitical topics, donning a mask has become partisanized to the point that people are brawling in supermarkets over their right to infect others. ""It's a free country; I can do what I want"" sounds charming when it comes from a child. It can be far worse when it is shouted from the mouth of a possibly infected adult. It's a strange sort of freedom that includes exposing other people to a potentially deadly virus. What's to resist about showing respect to your fellow Americans? Why turn a straightforward public health issue into a political one? The virus doesn't care whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. It ravaged blue states in the spring, and now it's plowing through red ones. All it cares about is finding open mouths and nostrils. It's crazy that we are having this debate after all. Dozens of countries have already mandated mask-wearing in public. It's not a coincidence that the United States remains the world's coronavirus hot spot. Only recently -- as the virus descends on the places where their political supporters live -- have some top Republicans come to their senses. On Thursday, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, whose state is currently being overwhelmed with new cases, issued a statewide mask mandate. (Indoor churchgoers are exempted, but outdoor protesters aren't.) There have been encouraging words from the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Vice President Mike Pence, even Sean Hannity. Earlier this week, Steve Doocy, a host of ""Fox & Friends,"" which has as direct a line to President Trump's brain as any top White House adviser, pleaded with the president to ""set an example"" and wear a mask. MAGA should now stand for ""Masks Are Great Again,"" he said. We're not holding our breath. Even with records being set daily, the White House refuses to issue a nationwide face mask mandate. Some resisters are still sore about the contradictory or incorrect messages about masks that came from health officials in early days of the pandemic. In late February, Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams tweeted: ""Seriously people -- STOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus."" Anthony Fauci said a version of this a few days later. ""There's no reason to be walking around with a mask,"" he told CBS. ""When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is."" These were missteps, without question. But remember the context in which those pleas were made. In early March, hospitals across the country were preparing for a massive surge of patients, and masks were in perilously short supply. Considering the significant risks to front-line health care workers, and the lack of sufficient protective gear, it was understandable -- even if misguided in retrospect -- to want to ensure that masks were available to those who needed them most.

There's also the uncertainty inherent to the scientific process. In the early stages of the pandemic, for instance, it wasn't clear that infected people who had no symptoms could transmit the virus, so there didn't appear to be a need for the general public to wear masks. Now, of course, it's clear that asymptomatic transmission most likely plays a big role in the virus's spread. This doesn't mean we should ignore the scientists, or accuse them, as Fox News's Laura Ingraham did, of being part of ""the medical deep state."" Scientists generate hypotheses based on what they know at the time; some turn out to be incorrect, so scientists adjust and come up with better hypotheses. That is how science works, and most of the time it happens out of the public view. But now, with the whole world watching and on edge, every error is magnified. In any case, it's long past time to stop blaming health officials' messaging. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance to recommend the wearing of masks on April 3; three months later, countless Americans are still refusing. Masks are not a cure-all for the coronavirus pandemic. Countries that have gotten the virus under control have done so through a robust public health response, including aggressive testing and contact tracing. We also need to properly fund research into vaccines and other treatments. Instead, the Trump administration has wound down its coronavirus task force, perhaps because Mr. Trump still seems to believe that, as he put it as recently as Wednesday, the virus is ""going to sort of just disappear, I hope."" The buck stops anywhere but here. The White House continues to deny that it has any responsibility to lead in this effort. On Thursday, Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump's top aides, said: ""People are not wearing masks. And I don't think they're not wearing masks because the president of the United States is not wearing a mask. They're not wearing a mask because nobody's saying put the mask on."" And all this time we thought the presidency was a bully pulpit. Alas, the leader of the free world still refuses to cover his face in public, although he did claim he was ""all for masks"" earlier this week. The way to deal with an abject failure of leadership like this is at the ballot box in November. But the way to deal with the pandemic's daily assault on America today is to do the things regular people can do with little to no effort: Wash hands regularly, practice social distancing and wear a mask. On this July 4 weekend, consider it the least you can do for your country.","This is not complicated, folks.",9fb07058-fbc5-5f92-a238-d6e4b613f9c3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/02/opinion/02wegman/02wegman-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=335773fc4fb80347f5b11c6127dd84da61c43e75aeb25863bb08f312139d7563&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Clockwise from top left: Vice President Mike Pence; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; President Donald Trump; Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.",9fb07058-fbc5-5f92-a238-d6e4b613f9c3,Demo_data/D1_imgs/19fb07058-fbc5-5f92-a238-d6e4b613f9c3.jpg,11,15
Opinion,An International Student's Plea,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/opinion/letters/coronavirus-student-visas.html," Kendrick Brinson for The New York Times

Re ""Visa Rules Are Seen as Way to Push Colleges to Revive In-Person Classes"" (news article, July 8): How brave does a person have to be to move to a new country alone, in pursuit of a college education? Imagine suddenly finding yourself in a place with another language and a completely different culture, and knowing you're putting your family at great financial strain in the process. To have such an opportunity is a blessing and a curse. It's building a new life with the constant fear that a swift stroke of the government's pen could end all your dreams. That's what happened to many international students on Monday, when the Trump administration required that they attend at least one in-person class to keep their visas. Millions saw their hopes crumble as they're now forced to leave America or forbidden from returning. We don't just choose America for the classes. We pay atrocious prices for an experience, a taste of a different life, the connections we build and the opportunities we gain. Are we really expected to pay that price to watch classes from our home countries and miss out on all we signed up for? I'm sure I speak for most international students when I say we sincerely hope this heartbreaking decision is reconsidered. Victoria Bremmenkamp

Re ""It's Time for Architects to Stand Up for Justice,"" by Michael Kimmelman (Critic's Notebook, Arts pages, June 13): I was shocked by the brutal efficiency of the cells at San Quentin State Prison when I began representing inmates there who were charged with new in-prison offenses more than 17 years ago. One client likened it to ""living in a bathroom,"" with a roommate. Yet the prison, which opened in 1852, is not without some architectural charm -- or at least honesty. The wrought-iron bars and hand-operated locks, gates and levers (which ""throw the bar"" to open or close 25 cells at once) make no pretense about their purpose. In contrast, modern penal facilities have adopted a clinical aesthetic, with featureless passageways and invisible staff operating remote-controlled doors and cameras. Each design dehumanizes inmates in its own way. But as the French philosopher Michel Foucault pointed out in his historical study of prison design, ""Discipline and Punish,"" it's the lack of privacy, the sense of always being watched, yet not knowing by whom, that is both prison architecture's most insidious feature, and its most effective means of control.

It was very disturbing to read that the Metropolitan Museum of Art has become yet another victim of the censure culture. Keith Christiansen, chairman of European paintings, posted a fair and timely question on his personal Instagram account recently asking, ""How many great works of art have been lost to the desire to rid ourselves of a past of which we don't approve."" And, to illustrate the point, he used an image of Alexandre Lenoir trying to save the royal tombs of Saint Denis during the French Revolution. In light of the current propensity to topple statues and monuments, it seems a fair and timely question. However, it caused such an outcry among a vocal constituency of Met workers that Mr. Christiansen was asked to remove his post and apologize to the entire staff. I was educated in a world where ideas and different points of view could be discussed freely and openly without causing a public outcry. Tragically, these days have vanished. We live in a society where the marketplace of ideas is ruled by censure and the endless desire to protect anyone who is offended by those who offer a different opinion or point of view. At this point, it appears that it's not just individuals who are in ""lockdown"" but also our thoughts and ideas. V.P.

Education,Pulling a More Diverse Group of Achievers Into the Advanced Placement Pool,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/us/pulling-a-more-diverse-group-of-achievers-into-the-advanced-placement-pool.html,"ORLANDO, Fla. -- Every year, more than 600,000 academically promising high school students -- most of them poor, Latino or black -- fail to enroll in Advanced Placement courses, often viewed as head starts for the college-bound. Some of them do not know about these courses, which offer an accelerated curriculum and can lead to college credit. Others assume they will be too difficult. But many are held back by entrenched perceptions among administrators and teachers, whose referrals are often required for enrollment, about who belongs in what has long served as an elite preserve within public schools. ""Many teachers don't truly believe that these programs are for all kids or that students of color or low-income kids can succeed in these classes,"" said Christina Theokas, director of research at the Education Trust, a nonprofit group. Ms. Theokas said that if those underrepresented students had taken A.P. courses at the same rate as their white and more affluent peers in 2010, there would have been about 614,500 more students in those classes. In an effort to overcome those obstacles, an increasing number of school districts, including Boston, Cincinnati and Washington, have recently begun initiatives to expand Advanced Placement course offerings and enroll more black and Hispanic students, children from low-income families and those who aspire to be the first in their generation to go to college. In the spring, lawmakers in Washington State passed legislation encouraging all districts to enroll in advanced courses any student who meets a minimum threshold on state standardized tests or the Preliminary SAT exam.

While some critics say A.P. classes are little more than another round of test prep, supporters say they can foster a culture of learning. Humberto Fuentes, a senior here at Freedom High School taking his first A.P. classes, in English literature and economics, said they were the first time he had been around peers who enjoyed school. ""In regular classes, people are trying to distract you with music videos or saying, 'Hey, look at this cat playing a piano' on their phones,"" said Humberto, 17, who emigrated with his parents from Ecuador when he was an infant and hopes to be the first in his family to attend college. ""Whereas in an A.P. class, they will show you something from the text and say, 'Hey, this is fun.' "" Expanding access to the advanced classes can require far more of teachers. ""If A.P. courses are going to be a successful experience for a variety of students,"" said Trevor Packer, the head of the Advanced Placement program at the College Board, the nonprofit organization that administers the exams, ""A.P. teaching can't rely on the 'sage on the stage' model that characterized and continues to characterize some of A.P. teaching today."" At Freedom High School, teachers offer tutoring at lunchtime, after school and on Saturdays. Starting this year, their district, Orange County Public Schools, allocated $12,000 to $14,000 to each high school to pay for extra instructional time for A.P. students. Many students are also enrolled in study review classes sponsored by Advancement Via Individual Determination, a nonprofit group that works to help prepare disadvantaged students for college. Cashira Chery, a lanky 14-year-old whose mother works as a hotel housekeeper, is one of the new A.P. students. In middle school, she was a straight-A student who scored well on standardized tests, and her guidance counselor at Freedom High registered her for two Advanced Placement courses, biology and geography.

As A.P. classes across the country have opened to a more diverse group of students, some teachers and parents worry that instructors will be forced to water down the curriculum, while some educational experts say there is little conclusive evidence that students who take such courses perform better in college. In Orlando, however, school officials are convinced that the courses will improve their students' chances in college. Three years ago, the district dropped its requirement of teacher recommendations for A.P. classes, and schools began mining data from Preliminary SAT exams more intensively to find students with the aptitude for more difficult courses. ""We wanted to find the students who might be flying under the radar,"" said Barbara Jenkins, superintendent of Orange County Public Schools, the country's 10th-largest school district, where about half the black and Latino students with qualifying test scores take A.P. classes. At Freedom High, a campus of 3,240 students, the administration began a push to increase A.P. enrollment five years ago, taking advantage of state bonuses for teachers whose students pass A.P. courses. Since 2009, the number of students taking the advanced courses at Freedom has nearly tripled, with the school offering 150 sections in 30 subjects, including macroeconomics, computer science and Mandarin.

This year, close to half the students in A.P. classes are Latino, 12 percent are black, and nearly half are eligible for free or reduced lunches. Schoolwide, 70 percent of students are Hispanic, 6 percent are black, and more than two-thirds qualify for lunch aid. At the same time, passing rates on A.P. exams have edged up. In 2009, 49 percent of the Freedom students who took one received a passing score of 3 or higher. whereas last year, the rate was 51 percent. Nationwide, the class of 2012 took 3.15 million A.P. exams, more than double the number a decade earlier, and 57 percent were passing scores. That rate was four percentage points lower than in 2002. When those additional 1.85 million tests were taken, the number of passing scores rose by more than one million from a decade earlier. Some parents around the country have resisted the expansion of A.P., saying classes are filling with students who cannot manage the work. And pass rates remain low: Last spring, 25 percent of African-Americans and 32 percent of Hispanics who took an A.P. English exam received a passing score; the rates in the social sciences were 30 percent and 35 percent. About two-thirds of white students who took an exam in English or a social science received a passing score. Some educational experts are skeptical that pushing more children into A.P. classes will help them. In research that has shown positive links between students who score a 3 or higher and their college performance, it is difficult to disentangle the factors, said Kristin Klopfenstein, the executive director of the Education Innovation Institute at the University of Northern Colorado. ""The things that cause kids to enroll in A.P. classes and do well in them are the same things that cause them to go to college and succeed in college,"" Dr. Klopfenstein said. ""Supportive families, a college-going culture at home, a high school with a college-going culture."" Some teachers say students who come from more educated backgrounds can help the new A.P. students. During an advanced calculus class at Freedom High one morning, the teacher, Amanda Kraemer, circulated among student groups of four working together to solve quadratic equations. Most of them, she said, did not have college-educated parents. But peer grouping, she said, ""gets kids who come in with a lot of skills to solidify them by helping other students."" Ms. Kraemer's approach seems to work: Last spring, more than 90 percent of her students received a passing score on the most rigorous A.P. calculus exam.","Confronting entrenched perceptions, schools have begun initiatives to enroll more poor, Latino and African-American students in Advanced Placement courses, which serve as an elite preserve within schools.",79e788f9-f59d-544e-8930-e2e4a0f9c1fb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/27/us/jp-ADVANCED-1/jp-ADVANCED-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=9574267ad1005ab80052cbefd5706925e5a1d0ef46ec8d4a97cea3c7002c6a25&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Advanced Placement students at Freedom High School in Orlando, Fla., are offered extra review sessions by a nonprofit group.",79e788f9-f59d-544e-8930-e2e4a0f9c1fb,Demo_data/D1_imgs/179e788f9-f59d-544e-8930-e2e4a0f9c1fb.jpg,22,22
Fashion & Style,Seeing Fashion Week from the First Row,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/fashion/instyle-laura-brown-new-york-fashion-week.html,"It was the fifth day of New York Fashion Week, and Laura Brown, the new editor in chief of InStyle magazine, had to be at the Zimmermann show on West 46th Street in five minutes. Unfortunately, she, her driver and her S.U.V. were stuck behind a Prince Lumber truck that could not seem to maneuver out of its parking spot on Washington Street. ""What are you trying to do, lumber man?"" she said. ""We've got fashion to go to!"" Wearing an animal print dress from Ganni and Saint Laurent stiletto boots, Ms. Brown was perched on the edge of her seat. The truck finally pushed out of the spot. And immediately began trying to get back in. ""Don't try to get back in there, buddy,"" Ms. Brown said. ""Prince Lumber, it's not your day.""

Finally, a quarter of an hour later, the truck found its way out and the S.U.V. headed uptown. Over the course of her 15 years in New York, Ms. Brown, who is from Sydney and still speaks with a pronounced Australian accent, has become a prominent figure in the fashion industry, appearing as a judge on Bravo's ""The Fashion Show,"" interviewing Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton for Harper's Bazaar and accumulating 119,000 followers on her Instagram account, where she posts photos with friends like Karolina Kurkova and Christy Turlington. Yet Ms. Brown insists that when it comes to street style, she is not the one the photographers are after. ""People are always rushing past me to get to Nicky Hilton or something,"" she said.

She took a sip of iced coffee, a routine unaffected by the 38-degree weather. ""I know it's weird,"" she said. ""I don't mind hot coffee, but this feels like a refreshing beverage."" So far that morning she had seen The Row (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's collection) and sat in the front row at Carolina Herrera. ""I bolted backstage after the show,"" she said. ""I'm always the first one. Security is like, 'What are you doing?' I'm like, 'I'm a friend! Not going to harm her!'""

Ms. Brown hoped that her day would end by 10 p.m. She goes to certain designers' dinners during fashion week -- Diane von Furstenberg's, for example -- but mostly avoids late-night parties. ""I'm a bit of a nana,"" she said. ""I burn bright and I flame out early."" Still, she had made time for one big bash the week before: InStyle's party for its March issue, the first that she had edited from front to back since leaving her post as executive editor of special projects at Harper's Bazaar in August. As part of her mission at InStyle, Ms. Brown wants the magazine to become more relatable, and to reflect the hybrid roles of many of today's celebrities. Hence, the inclusion of contributors like the writer and actress Lena Dunham, the fashion blogger and entrepreneur Leandra Medine, and the actress and model Hari Nef. Hence also, the cover star, Emily Ratajkowski, a model and actress known for her activist side (she campaigned for Bernie Sanders last year). When the car drew close to the Zimmermann show, Ms. Brown jumped out and jogged-slash-teetered down the remaining block, arriving with minutes to spare. After the show, she dashed off in search of the bathroom. It took her 15 minutes to get there. On the way, she chatted with Malcolm Carfrae, former head of communications for Ralph Lauren; congratulated Nicky Zimmermann; and posed for photos with Olivia Culpo, 2012 winner of the Miss USA pageant, and Shay Mitchell, an actress.

Back outside, her hobnobbing duties done, Ms. Brown grabbed Ruthie Friedlander, who runs InStyle's website, and Sam Broekema, the magazine's accessories director, and hopped back into her car. Inside, Mr. Broekema and Ms. Brown flipped through a stack of photos: accessories for the May issue that needed Ms. Brown's approval. ""It's the new Panther from Cartier,"" Mr. Broekema said in a French accent. ""Can you say 'Panther' again?"" Ms. Brown said. ""The only French I know is 'I'm tired' or 'I need my wine' French.""

Between shows, Ms. Brown recalled her first fashion weeks, in London in the late 1990s. ""I snuck into a couple of McQueen shows, but then I started to get invited,"" she said. ""I would be in, like, Row J or something."" It is Row J no more. The last stop before lunch was Proenza Schouler, where Ms. Brown was planted in the front, as she is at every show. Part of Ms. Brown's job is to know the right people, the interesting characters, the up-and-comers and the established players. The shows are a chance to pay her respects to the designers she knows and to take a peek at the ones she is curious about. The accumulated knowledge helps her choose looks for shoots and decide which designers to team up with for articles. It is a lot of socializing, and fashion is full of personalities -- and sometimes drama. The secret to Ms. Brown's success may be how effectively she keeps her head above it. ""Go be mad at something else,"" she said. ""I'm a nice girl and I'm happy to be here.""",InStyle's Laura Brown has long been a fashion-world favorite.

Fashion & Style,"From Dior, a Mystical Masked Ball",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/fashion/couture-christian-dior-ball.html,"Dior held a masked ball for more than 800 guests in the gardens of the Musee Rodin.

For Maria Grazia Chiuri, artistic director of Dior, and her colleagues, the dream apparently was a masked ball for more than 800 guests in the gardens of the Musee Rodin, site of the brand's couture show a few hours earlier.

Gone were the velvet cushions on the faux hedgerows, where guests had been seated to watch the collection; when the clocks struck 10, attendees made their way through the museum and out onto a path of glittering grass, lit by candles, projected shooting stars and a vast paper moon that had been strung up into the January night sky. Next, amid leafy labyrinthine fronds, came courteous jesters on stilts against a backdrop of magic mirrors, a chorus of farmyard animal noises, and a troupe of unicorns, both black and white, that nobly bowed as visitors walked by.

""Your greatest desire, Madame,"" the fortuneteller said once again, as a trio of giggling woodland nymphs sailed through gaps in the foliage -- floral garlands on their heads, Champagne flutes in their hands and all clad in the frothiest and twinkliest of ball gowns. Though guests at the ball were Dior's most esteemed couture clients, some of the world's most wealthy jet-setters, even they could scarcely believe their eyes. All had dressed for the occasion, removing velvet evening capes or tailored coats to reveal everything from glittering frocks to tuxedos. Most were paired with masks in a riot of color, feathers and lace, some given extra oomph by diamonds the size of golf balls clustered on their ears and wrists.

A huge ceiling mirror reflected the mystical scene back down onto the crowd, though few looked up from their revelries. If they had, they might have spied several famous faces: a braless Bella Hadid and maskless Kendall Jenner (the model had improvised with big black sunglasses), lounging around with the rapper A$AP Rocky, the activist Bianca Jagger in black fur and custard-colored duchess satin, the designer Tory Burch in an embroidered red jacket and the model Eva Herzigova in a simple white sheath (Dior, of course) and hammered gold mask encrusted with gems and finished with a pointed spike. There also was the entire Arnault clan (the billionaire family behind Dior), including Natalia Vodianova, resplendent in a high-necked floral gown and lace; her partner, Antoine Arnault; and even the patriarch Bernard Arnault, in a simple black mask, all partying the night away on a giant round floor, bedecked with the 12 signs of the zodiac.

Elsewhere, there were vast stone tables heaving with trifles, fruits and fondant fancies, and vogueing, penguin-suited waiters who popped out from bars built inside hedgerows. There were dancers and charmers, magicians and tree goddesses, and D.J.s at the decks long into the witching hours. In the end, most were in bed by 3 a.m. With two more days of shows, and a hectic schedule to meet, even the brightest young things appeared conscious of the need to return to reality -- and to grab a few hours of beauty sleep, before the morning light.","After the house's couture show, more than 800 guests gathered in the gardens of the Musée Rodin for a fairy-tale fantasy.",136bc74c-456b-58fb-a8a9-9859c03b7fcb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/24/fashion/24DIORBALL-web-exterior/24DIORBALL-web-exterior-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=50396447eb9bcdeee568365a723c1782c4a54a126acb72d023767151efadbb9c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Dior held a masked ball for more than 800 guests in the gardens of the Musée Rodin.,136bc74c-456b-58fb-a8a9-9859c03b7fcb,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1136bc74c-456b-58fb-a8a9-9859c03b7fcb.jpg,19,19
Fashion & Style,Zac Posen Presents New Uniforms for Delta,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/fashion/zac-posen-delta-air-lines-new-uniforms.html,"Zac Posen is a designer known for dressing celebrities like Reese Witherspoon and Claire Danes in fantastical Cinderella extravaganzas. But his latest project has very little to do with the red carpet -- though it does involve a runway of sorts, and it will be revealed at a catwalk show Tuesday in Atlanta. That, after all, is where Delta Air Lines is based. And Mr. Posen's latest collection -- all four dozen or so looks -- comprises the new uniforms for approximately 60,000 Delta employees working as ticket and gate agents, at the Sky Club and in flight. Employees are allocated a set of points so they can mix and match their outfits by choosing from different pieces, including dresses, skirts and blazers, coats, shirts and pants. Mr. Posen signed on in spring of last year. Though he acknowledged it was a leap from the collection that bears his name (and even his work for Brooks Brothers, where he is the creative director for women's, and David's Bridal, where he sells a line of wedding dresses), he said he wanted to do it for a variety of reasons, from his own love of travel to his belief in the power of a good uniform. And the fact that in designing for the friendly skies, he will be joining a line of fashion names that includes Cristobal Balenciaga (who designed uniforms for Air France); Pierre Cardin (Olympic Airlines); Emilio Pucci (Braniff Airways); Pierre Balmain (Singapore Airlines); and Julien MacDonald (British Airways).

""I do everything in a suit and a tie, from going to the office to walking my dog,"" Mr. Posen said. ""How you dress helps heighten your performance."" Though not every performance has the same requirements. ""This is not models on the runway at all,"" he said, noting that he shadowed Delta employees, including flight attendants and ticket agents, to get a sense of their dressing needs. ""These are people who have multiple tasks to do in their jobs. It takes great mental and physical concentration to do those tasks, and to be poised at the same time."" After the uniforms are revealed Tuesday afternoon, a select group of about 1,000 flight attendants, airport service agents and ground-support personnel will test them in action. The final rollout is expected in 2018.

As part of the design process, Mr. Posen worked with a committee of 24 Delta staff members and assessed feedback from 20,000 employees. Elaine Casanova, who has been a flight attendant for 43 years and says she has worn at least six different uniform iterations during that time, was on the committee. ""My biggest concern was that there would be a stain-resistant factor and that the uniforms be fairly wrinkle-free,"" she said. ""Also that the uniform would be able to go from a cold climate to a warm climate in one trip."" So what was the end result? A finished prototype of a blazer and skirt that Mr. Posen presented at his showroom last week was made of an ottoman fabric that's stain-resistant and stretchy. Inside the skirt is a rubber grip to help keep the shirt tucked in, and the blazer has a slot at the top for the walkie-talkies that flight attendants use to communicate. Anti-bacterial materials are woven into the lining of the jacket.

The colors of the uniform -- plum, thistle and cardinal as opposed to the standard blue -- may surprise frequent fliers. But the company and its employees wanted a change. When wearing the current shade, Mr. Posen said, ""they felt ordinary."" Another complaint that came up was that the old uniforms were too frumpy, according to Mr. Posen. Inspired by the form of airplanes and by the ergonomic lines of a vessel moving through space and air, Mr. Posen tried to rectify that grievance.

On a plum blazer for women, the back panel flares out, for example, emphasizing or exaggerating the wearer's curves. With the same purpose clearly in mind, a dress has two curved, scarlet lines that almost converge on the front. ""Making all bodies look beautiful is really key,"" he said. On a man's jacket, part of the lapel is sewn into the fabric for a smoother effect. Decorative scarves have patterns that change in scale to make the fabric appear more dimensional. Aside from the color, these changes may be too subtle for most casual fliers to register. The uniforms follow a classic formula of being fitted yet modest and don't scream designer (cool school principal is more like it). But Ms. Casanova, for one, was pleased. ""It's professional looking, but it's going to bring back glamour, which we had in the '70s,"" she said.","The designer, known for his extravagant red-carpet creations, collaborated with the airline to dress its 60,000 employees.",0fc68cce-4970-5f6d-a85d-0351a458c27f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/20/fashion/20POSEN-WEB2/20POSEN-WEB2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=84c3c99bc6abbc11f6d1da74ff9cd35767b2bc78f95365e7aeba102ea41733e9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Zac Posen's designs for Delta Air Lines' cabin crew.,0fc68cce-4970-5f6d-a85d-0351a458c27f,Demo_data/D1_imgs/10fc68cce-4970-5f6d-a85d-0351a458c27f.jpg,19,19
Health,Clinical Trials of Coronavirus Drugs Are Taking Longer Than Expected,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/health/covid-19-antibody-treatments.html,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc in the United States and treatments are needed more than ever, clinical trials for some of the most promising experimental drugs are taking longer than expected. Researchers at a dozen clinical trial sites said that testing delays, staffing shortages, space constraints and reluctant patients were complicating their efforts to test monoclonal antibodies, man-made drugs that mimic the molecular soldiers made by the human immune system. As a result, once-ambitious deadlines are slipping. The drug maker Regeneron, which previously said it could have emergency doses of its antibody cocktail ready by the end of summer, has shifted to talking about how ""initial data"" could be available by the end of September. And Eli Lilly's chief scientific officer said in June that its antibody treatment might be ready in September, but in an interview this week, he said he now hopes for something before the end of the year.

""Of course, I wish we could go faster -- there's no question about that,"" said the Eli Lilly executive, Dr. Daniel Skovronsky. ""I guess in my hopes and dreams, we enroll the patients in a week or two, but it's taking longer than that."" A spokeswoman for Regeneron, Hala Mirza, said that all clinical trials involved an early learning period, and that the company was ""seeing positive momentum in recent days"" as it has sent testing machines to some research sites and has broadened criteria to allow more patients to participate. While much of the world's focus has been on the race to create a coronavirus vaccine, new drugs could also help curb the pandemic by making the disease less deadly. Because drugs are typically tested in sick patients in smaller clinical trials, they can also be developed more quickly than vaccines.

Both companies rushed to develop their products in record time and began large studies this summer at dozens of hospitals and clinics around the country. They are testing various groups of patients, such as those who are positive but not yet sick enough to be hospitalized, and those who have been exposed to the virus from someone already infected. All of the trials compare the experimental drugs to a placebo, or sham treatment. The fast-moving disease has presented opportunities and challenges for the researchers testing antibodies. As the number of infections mounted in states like Florida, Texas and Arizona, there was no shortage of patients who would be eligible for trials. But at the same time, the outbreaks overwhelmed the very hospitals that would be overseeing the studies. In remote meetings with doctors at trial sites around the country, Dr. Skovronsky said some had to step out to care for patients who required emergency intervention. ""That doesn't happen when you're setting up diabetes trials or cancer trials,"" he said. ""We've had investigators say: 'Look, I'd love to do research, but I don't have time to set up a new trial. I've got an I.C.U. full of patients.'"" One major hurdle has been testing. In both of the outpatient trials run by Eli Lilly and Regeneron, doctors must compete with a ticking clock. According to the rules of the Regeneron trial, a patient must be treated with the antibodies within seven days of the onset of symptoms. Both the Regeneron and Eli Lilly trials require giving the drug within three days of taking a positive test. But with turnaround times in some areas lagging for five days or more, keeping within those time frames has proved difficult.

But as labs were inundated with samples, straining supply chains and delaying results, Dr. Kohli said enrolling patients became difficult. ""If people are getting tested at these facilities, but they don't have the results, then how do we enroll them in trials?"" she said.
* Who should get a booster shot? It depends, Dr. Scott Gottlieb says. Dr. Kohli said Regeneron sent her a rapid-testing machine to speed up the results, and Eli Lilly did the same for its trial, which she is also running. A spokeswoman for Regeneron said the company had sent out ""a few dozen"" testing machines to clinical trial sites, and was planning to send more in the coming days. Eli Lilly said it was working with state health departments and other local authorities to help speed up testing in certain areas, in addition to supplying some sites with testing machines. Other researchers said finding the right spot to give the experimental treatment to outpatients was complicated. Patients typically get tested at a drive-through site, and then return home, rarely visiting a hospital or clinic unless their condition gets worse. Bringing them into a medical center for treatment further strains the system, and risks infecting patients and health care workers who don't have Covid-19. Some sites have resisted bringing a highly infectious person onto their medical campuses, potentially sharing a lobby or elevator with people who do not have the virus. Once there, they must spend a few hours receiving an infusion of the treatment as well as getting blood tests and completing paperwork required for the study.

At some hospitals, officials have been able to use existing facilities. In Tyler, Texas, the UT Health North Campus medical center is an old tuberculosis hospital, with rooms that use negative air pressure to prevent viruses from spreading. But in other locations, like Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., finding the right spot has been a struggle. Dr. Joshua Purow, who is overseeing the Eli Lilly outpatient trial at the hospital, rushed to get his site ready once he saw that infections were rising in the area. But Holy Cross turned down his first choice, a corner of the emergency department, out of fears that the space would be needed for more severe Covid-19 patients. The idea of installing an outdoor tent was deemed too complicated, and refurbishing a room in a nearby office building would take precious weeks. Weeks passed before Dr. Purow finally secured a place to run the trial. It was in the emergency department, the first place he had requested. ""We finally have it all set up to go,"" Dr. Purow said. ""But now, our numbers are declining a little bit. We're not seeing as much as we thought we would."" So far, he said, he has enrolled just one participant, out of a hoped-for 25. Over all, the Eli Lilly outpatient trial is aiming for including 400 patients. The similar Regeneron study has a goal of enrolling about 1,500 patients. Not every trial site is seeing such hurdles. Dr. Jason Morris, who is overseeing the Eli Lilly study at his physician practice, Imperial Health, in Lake Charles, La., has already exceeded his goals and has enrolled about 45 patients. Dr. Morris said he or another doctor calls each person who tests positive for the virus at the group's urgent care clinic and tells them about the study.

Dr. Imad Shawa, who is leading the Eli Lilly trial at Franciscan Health Indianapolis, said people must decide whether to enroll in the trial before they get very sick. When test results come back, ""the majority of the time, patients are even slightly feeling better, or they're not getting any sicker,"" he said. ""So the perception is that all this is another mild thing that they can deal with."" Doctors who are running studies are prohibited from making a hard sell -- patients must be informed of the risks and benefits of participating, and the very nature of a clinical trial means that no one knows if the treatment will work. ""We can't sort of paint it as a positive or a negative,"" said Dr. G. Marshall Lyon III, who is leading the Regeneron clinical trials at Emory University in Atlanta. ""We don't know if it's going to be directly beneficial to you; we don't know if it's going to be harmful to you.""","Antibody trials sponsored by Regeneron and Eli Lilly are off to a slow start because of a dearth of tests, overwhelmed hospitals and reluctant patients.",b3ccb804-c098-514e-8621-636bb1a10a47,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/14/science/14VIRUS-TRIALS1/14VIRUS-TRIALS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=8ce9fae35a006ab428f5eeac8de325dda1216effa70e036b755f5cc0866f6fff&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A monoclonal antibody clinical trial site in Mesa, Ariz., is kept bare to ensure a faster disinfection process.

Books,"Without Places to Gather, Debut Novelists Reimagine Book Promotion",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/books/debut-novels-book-tours.html,"For many first-time novelists, years of hard work (and often solitary time) culminate in seeing their book come into the world: going to festivals and bookstores to read sections aloud and connecting with readers face to face, inhabiting with others the worlds they built. But with social distancing guidelines discouraging gatherings of more than 10 people, publishing a debut has changed in ways that authors couldn't have foreseen just a few weeks ago. We spoke to several debut novelists about their books, their plans to promote their work and their days during this unusual time. My book is a dark comedy about a young man, Claude McKay Love, coming of age on Chicago's South Side, trying to navigate universal teenager angst while dealing with societal pressures. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? I spent most of February touring and giving interviews. I was supposed to go on my final leg this upcoming week. By last Wednesday, as the severity of this situation clarified, after a few events canceled, we decided to cancel everything. It seemed silly to put people at risk of contracting and spreading the disease for a reading.

How are you spending it now? Now, my class at University at Buffalo has moved online. I also teach writing classes at Just Buffalo Literary Center. They've wisely closed. Until further notice, I'm hunkered down with my girlfriend, our dog and cat, video games, movies, writing projects and books. I'm editing my second novel. It's about an underground society that forms because America and the world are crumbling. Coming back to that work during these times is, well, surreal. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? Publishing and promoting a book is a stressful, maddening, exhausting, anxiety-inducing and wonderful process. This book has taken up almost all my head space the past few months. It was the most important thing to me. This crisis has brought me back to reality. I'm no longer afraid of bad reviews, empty readings or a lukewarm reception. I'm afraid for the world. I also feel a deeper appreciation for literature's ability to transport us away from the present. ""The Cactus League"" is a community novel that charts the path of Jason Goodyear, the Los Angeles Lions' fantastic but flawed left fielder, as the Lions make their way through spring training in Scottsdale, Ariz. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? My publicist and I worked together to build out an ambitious schedule of events at independent bookstores, schools and festivals, with the understanding that those readings and conversations really do sell books.

I was fortunate to complete the first half of my tour in February -- though I was in several Covid-19 hot spots, including Seattle, just days before the outbreak was detected there, and those happy, carefree -- and crowded -- gatherings now seem a bit ominous. I had a second leg charted -- visiting spring training and the Tucson Book Festival, then speaking to several university writing programs, including my graduate alma mater, Louisiana State University. I was supposed to be watching a Brewers spring training game right now! How are you spending it now? I'm trying to book podcast and radio interviews as much as I can, and I'm being pretty emphatic on social media about supporting not just my novel but all debut writers and independent bookstores (book events are a major driver of sales for them, too). I'm also spending a lot of time on triage at work -- by day I run The Paris Review. Making sure my colleagues were safe and healthy and ready to go remote, and postponing our 400-person awards dinner and fund-raiser, also have kept me plenty busy. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? I'd love to plug the new website bookshop.org. You can order online, but the sales are fulfilled by indies, based on your geography. It just launched -- in the nick of time. My debut novel, ""Temporary,"" is the story of a temporary worker who is assigned a series of surreal and improbable jobs on her quest for permanence -- she works as a pirate, an assassin, a ghost and even a bank robber. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? I am a former theater kid, and a well-known ham, so more than anything I was looking forward to putting on a show. I think that when readers trek out to a book event, it's such a great way of saying ""thank you"" to do something a little bit different than a straightforward reading. For the Brooklyn launch, I had planned a performance of several sections of my novel, with a Greek chorus of readers, including the author Diane Cook, and the writer and podcast host Dennis Norris II. Coffee House Press, Emily Books and I had put together a tour of about 17 events in 12 different cities around the country.

I was devastated to see these events disappear. It took so much time and care to put a tour together. I have been saving airline miles and taking on extra work for years to make it possible. My family has been planning to come to New York for months, and after they canceled their flights (the right decision), I spent a good hour crying and watching ""Love Is Blind."" Writing a book can be incredibly lonely, and I was so looking forward to the chance to share it with the people I love and admire, in person. How are you spending it now? Books Are Magic was set to host my book launch on Friday, March 13 (I know, I know). In the face of everything happening in the world, and after obsessively refreshing Twitter, it became clear that the events around my book were kaput. And then! The writer and bookstore owner Emma Straub had me and my editor, Emily Gould, stop by the store yesterday to film a short Q. and A. for Instagram. They even let me sing a couple of songs on my ukulele. And yesterday evening, my husband, along with the debut author Emma Copley Eisenberg, hosted a surprise digital book launch over Zoom. There were so many friends from near and far, and my mom was even able to join the video! People were on the chat with their babies, their toddlers, their dogs. Whole families were able to attend! There were old friends from high school and college, and friends from Twitter and the writing world who I have still never met in real life. It was incredibly moving. I had had a glass of wine, and so the evening ended with some vocal stylings, impressions of Idina Menzel and Audra McDonald, and a group rendition of ""So Long, Farewell"" from ""The Sound of Music."" That's something that never would have happened at a live event. It had a different, cozy energy, kind of like a literary sleepover.

""Under the Rainbow"" is about what happens when a queer task force is sent into the most homophobic town in America. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? I had a launch event on March 10 that was quite sparsely attended, and I was supposed to be a panelist at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books in April, which was just moved to the fall. I have another April event called Literary Orange that I suspect will be canceled, and even if it isn't, I don't think I'll feel comfortable attending. How are you spending it now? At home, anxious in old pajamas, which is basically my default setting! I'm spending a lot of time on Twitter and Instagram, trying to interact with people who are willing to amplify books coming out right now. Is there anything else you want to add or has been on your mind in connection with this? I think certain themes from my novel could really resonate with people right now: being trapped in a place you don't want to be (the most homophobic town in America, your tiny apartment), disruption of the status quo. Individual people are doing a lot to help -- next week I'm going on the Debutiful podcast for what the host is calling a Virtual Book Tour episode that will work just like a tour event, with a short reading followed by questions about the book. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book?

Definitely been a hard hit, especially this being my first novel -- I wanted to go all out. I was going to the A.W.P. conference in San Antonio to be part of two panels there. For the book release, I was going to do a church drag show. And then I thought, I didn't want my book to have the pandemic looming over it. We could have gone through with it, but I didn't want that looming over it. I wanted it to be something celebratory. I was going to fly to L.A. next week and do two events there, and then the San Antonio Book Festival. I still have my ticket to go to New York mid-April, but am going to reassess. How are you spending it now? Yesterday, when I announced that I wasn't going to do the event here and was canceling the rest of the California tour, some people started reaching out to me. Friends with different skills asking if I wanted do a live reading, to video myself and post it on different sites. What's been happening today is reimagining what it will look like, mainly through the internet. It's not ideal, because I like seeing and hearing people, touching people, doing something live. The feeling is different. But it's about the circumstances and accepting what you can't control. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? A lot of the queer community is talking about elders and H.I.V., how to really tap into resources for folks that actually need them. And having conversations about how the queer community went through something like this, and we have avenues of how to deal with this. People are asking for people's Venmos, donating $50 or $100 to folks -- some underground economy starting. ""New Waves"" is a novel about how work culture bleeds into how we approach all the things in our personal life -- grief, racism, the internet, etc. It's funnier than how I just made it sound, though.

How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? I had a launch event at Books Are Magic, which had a really great turnout. At drinks afterward, a running theme was: ""This is the last time I'm going out for a while."" So I'm lucky that for pub day, I had a crowd of friends, family and strangers that felt celebratory. The rest of my tour will likely be postponed. It's disappointing, but there are larger things at stake than my in-your-feelings literary novel. How are you spending it now? Mostly texting and DMing with other writers who had books coming out around now. There are some people who are really crushed. I'm also on a handful of email threads with other authors -- most of whom I've never met, just people who are in the same boat. A sinking tide bums out all boats, I guess. I'm trying to figure out some more creative ways to keep up the energy around my book and others that dropped in the past few weeks. Everyone keeps suggesting doing livestreams in lieu of the events that have been canceled. I don't think it's a terrible idea, but I'm not entirely confident that these are ways people want to experience readings. There might be an upside, though: I think it may push authors and editors to think of creative, ambitious ways to do digital projects. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? A lot of the authors, publicists and editors I've talked to feel defeated by the circumstances. I get it. I'm definitely discouraged a bit, too. But there's an opportunity here, if we can all figure it out. The reality is that book events, while still effective in some ways, are becoming increasingly irrelevant. Which makes sense. Reading is a private, intimate act. Book tours have been a way to try and make these things social. (How many events do you go to that feel like they drag on for too long?) They're also expensive, and unless you're one of a handful of already well-established authors, publishers are seeing them as an expense with very little return. I'm hoping these hurdles encourage us to think about how book promotion can be reinvented.

""The Mountains Sing"" is a journey into Vietnam's 20th-century history via the lives of four generations of the Tran family. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? My publisher and I, as well as independent bookstores, several universities and cultural organizations worked for months together to develop a very exciting book tour which would take me to meet readers in many cities. I have my tickets to fly all the way from Indonesia, where I am currently based, to the United States. I planned to present my book in unique Vietnamese ways, including singing and performances. I had my ao dai dresses tailor-made for the events. I was very looking forward to conversations with writers whom I most admire, including Viet Thanh Nguyen, Thi Bui, Isabelle Thuy Pelaud, Wayne Karlin, Madeleine Thien, Karl Marlantes and Ethelbert Miller, and I am devastated the book tour has been canceled. How are you spending it now? I am searching for online ways to interact with readers, via social media and press interviews. According to the Vietnamese saying, ""trong cai rui co cai may -- good luck hides inside bad luck,"" this difficult time reveals the amazing and supportive spirit of the literary community. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? I fought my whole life to be able to become a writer, and now I need to fight against the coronavirus situation for my debut novel in English to reach readers' hands. My heart goes out to everyone who has been affected by this calamity. Amid all this, there is a need to keep the book business afloat by lending a hand to indie booksellers, publishers, authors. Books help keep us calm and are essential during this time of social distancing. For those reasons, I will be buying as many books released this month and next month as I can.

""Lakewood"" is about a young black woman who joins a government-sponsored research study in an attempt to pay off her family's debts. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? I was scheduled to go to several independent bookstores, read at some university-sponsored events, talk at a high school, go to Booktopia (a small literary festival in Vermont this year) and give craft talks for organizations like Literary Cleveland. How are you spending it now? I'm working with some other writers to possibly do some digital readings via Instagram Live. I'll still be on some podcasts and guest-editing some Instagram feeds. I'm going to Skype into some book clubs. We're trying to reschedule book tour stuff for late April, early May, but that feels optimistic. I'm worried about the independent bookstores that are impacted by this. A lot of them have been incredible advocates for me and ""Lakewood."" I'll probably spend way more of this time encouraging friends and family to buy my book, any book, from them via online sales. Before, I would've been telling people to come out and get into the stores. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? One thing that has changed during book promotion for me is that at the beginning of it, the majority of people wanted to talk to me about race and the implications of it in ""Lakewood."" A lot of comparisons to ""Get Out"" were made. Now, because so much of the book's plot speaks toward economic inequities, toward the deep inequity in the U.S. health care system, we're now talking about how uncomfortably relatable the book has become to many more people due to Covid-19. The only positive I can take at the moment from this pandemic is that maybe it will help the unconvinced understand how cruel it is not to have easily accessible and affordable health care. It's about an Iranian bus driver in Tehran who reluctantly gets involved in politics and pays a heavy price, getting thrown into jail because he attended a strike organized by a union and spending a lot of time in solitary confinement.

How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? We had a few events lined up. The book launch was March 24, scheduled to be at the Center for Fiction, and I was excited to be in conversation with Shirin Neshat, the Iranian visual artist and filmmaker. Then I was heading to Australia in late April for the Sydney Writers' Festival (which is canceled, too), and then another festival in New Jersey. It was about half a dozen events, all of them canceled. Some postponed -- well, hopefully all postponed. Then there is the baby my wife just had yesterday, who was overdue, a week after due date. I was looking forward to the birth of these two things, one human, one book. One born all right, the other one ... facing a lot issues. How are you spending it now? I'll still be doing an NPR interview. To be honest with you, I'm so preoccupied with the baby that I don't care very much at the moment. It's kind of a blessing in disguise. I was concerned that I would be away from my family, and it's nice to be with them. I also teach at CUNY in Harlem. Those classes are also canceled. It's weird to think -- it feels like everything was put on hold as soon as he was born. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? I don't really know. It's a very weird coincidence. To have your life, all of these events of intensity meeting at one point within the span of a couple days. It's very complicated. I haven't really thought through it that much yet. If you have any kind of belief in the fact that no coincidence is entirely coincidental, then this is good material for obsessive thinking. ""Catherine House"" is a gothic literary suspense novel set at a mysterious cultlike college with a dangerous secret agenda. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book?

Art & Design,Dutch Golden Age Art Wasn't All About White People. Here's the Proof.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/arts/design/black-portraits-dutch-golden-age.html,"""Bust of a Boy With a Turban""; left, by Gerrit Dou, and ""King Caspar"" by Hendrik Heerschop at the Rembrandt House Museum in Amsterdam.





AMSTERDAM -- Rembrandt's 1661 painting, ""Two African Men,"" is one of the Dutch old master's more inscrutable works. One man, dressed in a Roman-style costume and shawl, seems to be giving a speech, while another man leans attentively over his shoulder. The canvas was painted with a thin layers of earth tones and looks unfinished, but it bears the artist's signature. Why did Rembrandt paint it, and who were his subjects? These were some of the questions that came to mind for Stephanie Archangel in 2015 as she found herself lingering in front of the work at the Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery in The Hague. A sociologist by training, she had been searching in paintings ""for black people in which I could recognize myself,"" said Ms. Archangel, who was born and raised on Curacao, an island that was once a Dutch colony. Described by the Mauritshuis's website as likely showing ""free men who lived in Amsterdam,"" Rembrandt's portraits seemed ""human and worthy,"" Ms. Archangel said. ""It was the first time I saw black people in the 17th century painted by a Dutch master looking proudly back at me,"" said Ms. Archangel, who is now a junior curator at the Rijksmuseum. ""I was wondering if that was true or not, or if it was my imagination, or just my hope to see that kind of proud representation.""

This was the genesis of the exhibition at the Rembrandt House, ""HERE: Black in Rembrandt's Time,"" the product of a four-year process of research and investigation by Ms. Archangel, Mr. Kolfin and their colleagues at the museum. [Note: The Rembrandt House Museum is closed as part of the response to the coronavirus pandemic.] The show includes 56 paintings, prints and art objects from the Dutch Golden Age, including seven by Rembrandt. (""Two African Men,"" the inspiration for the exhibition, isn't one of them, though; as a condition of its donation, it is never allowed to leave the Mauritshuis.) In addition, the exhibition includes 15 contemporary artworks linked to the subject matter. ""HERE: Black in Rembrandt's Time,"" is part of a cultural paradigm shift in the Netherlands, where the Dutch Golden Age has long been associated almost exclusively with the achievements -- and the portraits -- of the 17th-century white, mostly male elite. This so-called decolonization of museums has not been embraced by everyone, but for some people who have not seen their histories reflected in museum displays, it seems like a move in the right direction.

Ms. Archangel said that the focus of the show is on images that present ""the many different roles that black people played in society, and the many different roles they played in paintings for artists."" The exhibition, she added, ""portrays more than what we knew before, which were mostly images of servants and enslaved people."" In the 17th century, the Netherlands was deeply involved in the international slave trade, but slavery was prohibited on Dutch soil. People of African descent who lived in the Netherlands at that time came as servants brought over by immigrant families, said Mark Ponte, an historian with the Amsterdam City Archives, and the lead researcher for the Rembrandt House exhibition. Mr. Ponte specializes in early modern migration and the history of the trans-Atlantic slave trade: Using marriage, birth and death records, he was able to reconstruct a network of about 100 black people who lived in Amsterdam during Rembrandt's time. The women he identified were mostly servants in the homes of Sephardic Jewish families who had emigrated to the Netherlands from Portugal, and most of the men were Brazilian sailors who worked in the shipping trade. Mapping their addresses in the city center, Mr. Ponte discovered that many lived in what is now called the Jewish Cultural Quarter, where Rembrandt once had a studio; some of them may have served as his models. Mr. Ponte and the curators said they wanted to connect the black residents of Rembrandt's neighborhood to the images the artist created. In total, Rembrandt created at least 26 images of black subjects, by Mr. Kolfin's count (12 paintings, eight etchings and six drawings), and most of these were probably based on his neighbors, whether they posed for him, or he observed them on the street. ""Dutch artists like to paint what's in front of them,"" said Mr. Kolfin. From the 1620s to the 1660s, there was a marked increase in Africans in Amsterdam, he added, as evidenced by Mr. Ponte's research. ""But it's been impossible to link the names to the faces, which is disappointing,"" Mr. Koflin added.

Rembrandt was certainly not the only old master who painted black subjects. Thousands of images of the African diaspora in European art dating back to antiquity are listed in ""The Image of the Black in Western Art,"" a series of 10 books, initiated in the 1960s and now released through Harvard University Press. Black people can be found ""in quite a large number of 17th-century images,"" Mr. Kolfin said. ""However, always small, or positioned in the background or a corner, always subsidiary."" When a painter featured a black figure as a central subject, he said, usually they would be cast in a biblical role, such as Caspar, one of the three Wise Men, or as a eunuch. Adrienne L. Childs, an independent scholar who co-curated the exhibition ""The Black Figure in the European Imaginary"" at the Cornell Fine Arts Museum in 2017, said that the vast majority of those images are either stereotypical or exoticized portrayals. In cases of portraits, they were often used by the painter to signal the status of the white figures in the painting, since having slaves or servants was considered to be a sign of power and wealth.","The period has long been associated with the portraits of its 17th-century white elite. But there are many overlooked paintings of black subjects, as an exhibition in Amsterdam shows.",11d59844-daff-5084-b94a-c29ad7722398,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/15/arts/15black-amsterdam8/15black-amsterdam8-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=f6affb72aa1a64da610da4d4bc4031704c840ebfc378720e56516d47ffa5014e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;Bust of a Boy With a Turban&rdquo;; left, by Gerrit Dou, and &ldquo;King Caspar"" by Hendrik Heerschop at the Rembrandt House Museum in Amsterdam.",11d59844-daff-5084-b94a-c29ad7722398,Demo_data/D1_imgs/111d59844-daff-5084-b94a-c29ad7722398.jpg,14,14
Sports,"Deep Within Relief Bill, Horse Racing Gets New Tools to Clean Up",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/sports/horse-racing/horse-racing-doping-usada.html,"No one much liked the horse breeder and owner Arthur Hancock III in the spring of 1991 after he delivered what he now calls his ""drugs-and-thugs speech"" to the University of Arizona Symposium on Racing. He had spoken openly about thoroughbred racing's dirty little secret: that too many of its horses were running on performance-enhancing drugs or were so doped up on anti-inflammatories and painkillers that they were running unnaturally fast and hurting themselves, often fatally. It was not only the horses that were suffering but also people like Hancock, who had made a living breeding fast horses for generations, and others who harbored a passion for thoroughbreds. Horse racing, Hancock said then, was losing market share to other sports, and even casinos had a better reputation than one of America's oldest pastimes. Horse racing needed some law and order. Hancock offered up what he called the Horse Racing Act of 1992, which called for drug-free racing, uniform rules backed by stiff penalties and a central office to enforce them.

""How are we going to compete with these if we are not in control of our own destiny and if we are perceived by the masses of fans and potential fans as being dishonest and riddled by drugs and thugs?"" Hancock, now 77, asked those in attendance. Nearly 30 years later, Hancock and others are finally getting help cleaning up the sport in the form of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act, a provision included deep in the measure signed Sunday by President Trump to provide $900 billion in pandemic aid and to fund the government through September. The horse racing measure, which takes effect July 1, 2022, calls for a board overseen by the Federal Trade Commission to write rules and penalties to be enforced by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, which regulates Olympic athletes in the United States and which revealed Lance Armstrong's cheating and issued him a lifetime suspension in 2012. ""It gives the horse industry a future,"" Hancock said. ""We were a rogue nation -- now we are not."" The changes, certainly overdue, were needed badly. In the spring, federal prosecutors issued indictments accusing more than 30 trainers, veterinarians and drug company representatives of doping racehorses and cheating the public.

The indictments told of a drug culture that had taken a deep hold within the sport, with owners chasing big purses and a fear among trainers to hold crooked competitors accountable. One of the people indicted was the trainer Jason Servis, who trained a well-known winner in Maximum Security and was accused of covertly administering performance-enhancing drugs to horses under his care. Servis pleaded not guilty. By November, Bob Baffert, the sport's most decorated trainer and in many ways the face of horse racing, issued a public apology and promised to do better following drug tests failed by his horses. Baffert has had 29 tests failed by horses over the past four decades, including four in the past six months. Many of those cases were met with modest fines or short suspensions, as Baffert said he did nothing wrong and blamed the test results on environmental contamination or human error. The new structure could change how similar cases are investigated and judged. ""This is a watershed moment for our sport,"" said James L. Gagliano, chief operating officer of the Jockey Club, one of horse racing's oldest and most influential organizations. ""We have a chance to regulate our sports at high standards. If you don't have safe and clean sport, you don't have anything."" Horse racing arrived at this moment because, in 2012, Hancock and his wife, Staci, founded the Water Hay Oats Alliance with the mission of getting drugs out of racing. They grew it to more than 1,800 industry members who shamed horsemen, veterinarians, politicians and regulators into treating thoroughbreds like athletes rather than commodities. Among the most notable opponents to cleaning up racing were Churchill Downs Inc. -- the host of the Kentucky Derby, America's most famous race -- and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the Senate majority leader, who counts the company among his top patrons. In 2016, Hancock said McConnell told him that he could not push an earlier version of the bill until Churchill Downs got on board. ""We don't believe a federal bill is practical, reasonable, or imminent,"" Bill Carstanjen, chief executive of Churchill Downs, told The New York Times in a statement in 2019.

In a memo obtained by The Times that laid out Churchill Downs's opposition to the bill, the company cited costs and the fact that trainers and veterinarian groups were against the measure. The memo also pointed to the antidoping agency's role in bringing down Armstrong, suggesting USADA might hurt the sport by finding and publicizing problems. Over the summer, in the midst of a competitive re-election battle, McConnell brought Hancock's group and the Jockey Club together with Churchill Downs. The one thing all sides could agree on was that Kentucky was the center of a $5.2 billion ecosystem that put 61,000 people to work. Between the doping scandals and a run of fatal breakdowns in Southern California that attracted national news and the attention of animal rights activists, the sides settled their differences and agreed on a federal bill that won bipartisan support. The industry will pay for the national authority and its enforcement efforts.",A provision deep in the coronavirus stimulus package puts the United States Anti-Doping Agency in charge of regulating thoroughbred racing.,acb79a03-1fc8-577b-9d9a-25f0f2d4b5e2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/30/sports/29horseracing-bill-print/29horseracing-bill1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Opening day of horse racing at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, Calif.",acb79a03-1fc8-577b-9d9a-25f0f2d4b5e2,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1acb79a03-1fc8-577b-9d9a-25f0f2d4b5e2.jpg,9,20
Opinion,"Gilad Shalit, Israel's Son, Is Getting Married",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/opinion/international-world/gilad-shalit-engaged.html,"Ms. Weiss is an Opinion staff writer and editor, and the author of "" How to Fight Anti-Semitism .""



Imagine that a 19-year-old American soldier was captured by terrorists and dragged through a tunnel across our border. Imagine that the U.S. Army failed to recover this abducted soldier and that he remained in terrorist hands for weeks that turned into months that became years. Imagine that the entire nation came to know this soldier's name and that every day, at schools across the country, children prayed for his release. Imagine that pop stars wrote songs about this young man with lyrics like: ""You will return, you will return / You, behold, are the child of all of us.""

Imagine that all of this went on for five years. Then imagine that one day, against all odds, he returned, gaunt and pale. And you and everyone around you -- a whole country -- got to watch him quietly, slowly and then gorgeously find his way back to life. It would move you to tears. It would make you believe all the cliches about how life can change in an instant, about never giving up hope. It might even transform how you saw your country and the world. That is exactly what happened last week in Israel. In 2006, a 19-year-old from northern Israel named Gilad Shalit was kidnapped by Hamas in a cross-border raid. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in the ambush. Shalit, wounded, was dragged through an underground tunnel into the Gaza Strip. Initial attempts by the Israeli military to rescue him failed, and so the push to save him became a public one, led by Shalit's parents, Aviva and Noam. First they walked for 12 days from their village to Jerusalem. Then they set up a tent outside the prime minister's home. And they did not move.

They were joined in that tent, and at demonstrations across the country, by regular Israelis. Jews around the world held rallies. Activists plastered Shalit's face on billboards, hung signs declaring ""Gilad is still alive"" and placed life-size cardboard cutouts of the soldier around the country. And this is to say nothing of the campaign on social media, where it seemed every profile picture was replaced by Gilad Shalit's face.

In a country with compulsory conscription for Jewish citizens, it was not a stretch for people to insist that it could be their father, their brother, their son, left to rot in a hole in Gaza. There are Americans rotting in similar holes. Iran has disappeared the C.I.A. consultant Robert Levinson for more than 13 years. The Islamic Republic is also holding captive Baquer Namazi, an 83-year-old former representative for Unicef who is in poor health, and his son, Siamak. Paul Overby, an author from western Massachusetts, has been missing since May 2014 when he was kidnapped in Afghanistan. Austin Tice, a former Marine and a freelance journalist, is in his eighth year of captivity in or around Syria. Last month, Moustafa Kassem, an Egyptian-American who was arrested more than six years ago, starved himself to death in an Egyptian prison. I'm embarrassed to admit that I had to Google some of those names. In contrast, like many of the world's 14 million Jews, I came to feel as if Gilad Shalit was a family member. Which is really the only way to understand why, in October 2011, Israel released 1,027 prisoners, some of them hardened terrorists, more than 300 of whom were serving life sentences, in exchange for this one ordinary soldier. To the casual observer, the exchange defied rationality. But only 14 percent of Israelis opposed it. Among them were parents just like the Shalits -- only their sons and daughters had been murdered in terrorist attacks ordered by the people Israel was now freeing. Some quickly made good on their promise to kill again. And yet an overwhelming majority of Israelis -- 79 percent -- supported the exchange.

It also proved that the nation-state of the Jewish people functions as a family in a way that occasionally makes normal statecraft, the national calculations of power and interest, irrelevant. The reason Gilad had to be saved, at whatever cost, was because he was kin. And so when the news broke on Valentine's Day that he had proposed to his girlfriend, Nitzan Shabbat, the joy was familial, too, as if a brother who had miraculously cheated death wasn't just surviving, but was given a chance at a second life. In a way I'm hesitant to make this particular joy anyone's but Gilad's. He and his fiancee deserve to keep every ounce of it for themselves. But the truth about national pride is that it isn't a finite resource. It is something that multiplies exponentially. It makes me wonder what kind of country America would become if we regularly, collectively, campaigned for the release of our fellow citizens whose names I had to look up. What would change about this country if we felt that their fate was our responsibility? Perhaps it would help us remember that we have a shared destiny to begin with. I'm certain that any pointy-head would tell you that it is foolish for any country, especially a young one rapidly becoming much bigger and more powerful, to willingly hostage its foreign policy to the fate of a single soldier. But it seems to me there is a lot of wisdom in thinking of a country more like a family. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Automobiles,Makers of Self-Driving Cars Ask What to Do With Human Nature,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/automobiles/wheels/makers-of-self-driving-cars-ask-what-to-do-with-human-nature.html,"Makers of Self-Driving Cars Ask What to Do With Human Nature

EVEN before Tesla revealed that a fatal accident had occurred while one of its cars was in semiautonomous driving mode, a debate was well underway between researchers and engineers: Is it possible to get a driver to safely take back control of a car once the vehicle has started driving itself? The question is relevant not only for cars of the future but also for ones already on the road. While the Tesla Model S has been getting all the attention in the last week, the fact is that many cars, including models from BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, now have systems that use a combination of adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping and automatic braking to enable drivers to briefly take their hands off the wheel and their eyes off the road. Some Tesla drivers have reveled in making videos of themselves using the Autopilot feature. But the more conventional automakers have designed their systems to take control of the car for only a few seconds at a time; the driver must be ready to resume command at any time.

In the safety agency's taxonomy, the next step would be Level 3, which describes vehicles that can drive on their own in specific circumstances, such as on the highway, but still require a human driver to be ""available for occasional control, but with sufficiently comfortable transition time."" But the technology giant Google, as it continues working toward what the company hopes will one day be a commercially available autonomous vehicle, has concluded that meeting such a requirement is not possible and the only safe way to proceed is to take the driver out of the equation. Some conventional automakers are beginning to agree. Volvo, whose Level 2 cars include the 2017 S90, has decided to skip the Level 3 stage. Like Google, Volvo is pursuing Level 4 cars -- fully autonomous vehicles that don't require any driver input aside from setting a destination. A car changing lanes at 50 miles per hour should not expect a driver to be able to suddenly take control, said Erik Coelingh, who leads Volvo's autonomous-vehicle research program, Drive Me. ""Some people can take control in 10 seconds, but if someone fell asleep it could take two minutes,"" he said.

A camera used in Volvo's project to develop a fully self-driving car. ""I was in a driving simulator a couple of weeks ago, and they asked me to play Dots on my phone"" while the virtual car was in control, Mr. Coelingh said. ""Then there was a voice asking me politely to take control, and I was like, 'Just give me a couple more seconds to beat the high score.'"" Experiments conducted last year by Virginia Tech researchers and supported by the national safety administration found that it took drivers of Level 3 cars an average of 17 seconds to respond to takeover requests. In that period, a vehicle going 65 m.p.h. would have traveled 1,621 feet -- more than five football fields. Despite such startling findings, some automakers and researchers say it is too soon to abandon human intervention as vehicles become more autonomous. ""I'm hesitant to write off Level 3,"" said Shane McLaughlin, the director of the Center for Automated Vehicle Systems at Virginia Tech, who thinks additional technology may yet solve the human handoff problem. ""I feel like we can get the machine to give the person enough time to react,"" he said.

Those in favor of taking a step-by-step transition that includes Level 3 cars point to the serious challenges still facing developers of fully autonomous Level 4 vehicles. Gill Pratt, who was recruited to lead Toyota's five-year, $1 billion project in automotive artificial intelligence, gave a presentation in January highlighting the ways a completely autonomous vehicle would need to be able to handle unusual situations. A viable autonomous car would need to be able, he said, to avoid a mattress falling off a moving truck on a crowded highway, even if it had never encountered such a situation before. Erik Coelingh, who leads Volvo's autonomous-vehicle research program, said a car changing lanes at 50 miles per hour should not expect a driver to be able to suddenly take control. Manuela Papadopol, the director of global marketing at Elektrobit, a technology supplier to the auto industry, advocates a gradual evolution by carmakers like Ford and General Motors that lets consumers become accustomed to the technology while automakers gather more data on the systems. Audi also supports incremental advances, rather than trying to leap ahead to fully autonomous cars. ""We're making sure the conditions are right to begin Level 3,"" said Brad Stertz, Audi's director of government affairs. ""The key part is focusing on driver availability."" Mr. Stertz said that when Audi was ready to offer Level 3 features, its system would give drivers audible and visual warnings if they appeared not to be paying attention. The system, planned for an Audi A8 in model year 2018, would at first be able to drive itself only under specific circumstances, such as in stop-and-go traffic on the highway at 35 m.p.h. or slower.",The difficulty of getting drivers to take control of automated cars when necessary has prompted many automakers to take people out of the equation.,8d5754b1-b095-5842-81d5-03ec03c591c3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/07/business/07WHEELS-1/07WHEELS-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=cc12f3acd15caf42fcfed09512b7961116aaa1c897be2407009ebaa892959eb0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An image from the Volvo Drive Me research program.

Sports,"Larry Baer, San Francisco Giants C.E.O., Is Suspended by M.L.B.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/sports/larry-baer-video-suspension.html,"Larry Baer, the chief executive of the San Francisco Giants, has been suspended without pay over a video that shows him in a public altercation with his wife.

Larry Baer, the chief executive of the San Francisco Giants, has been suspended without pay until July over a video that shows him involved in a public altercation with his wife, the commissioner of Major League Baseball announced on Tuesday. Mr. Baer has been on a leave of absence from the team since March 4, time away that the league said would now be converted to an unpaid suspension. During the approximately four-month suspension, which goes through July 1, Mr. Baer ""shall have no involvement in the operations of the Giants."" The team will be put under the control of someone selected by the team's ownership group, a statement from Major League Baseball said. In the meantime, Mr. Baer must be evaluated by an expert to determine an appropriate treatment and counseling plan, the statement said. The baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred, said league investigators had reviewed video footage of the March 1 episode, in which Mr. Baer was seen lunging for a cellphone in his wife's hand and forcefully grabbing her. They struggled, and she fell to the ground.

In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Manfred said that he had met with Mr. Baer and that he had concluded that Mr. Baer's conduct was ""unacceptable under M.L.B. policies and warrants discipline.""

""In determining the appropriate level of discipline, I find that Mr. Baer should be held to to a higher standard because as a leader he is expected to be a role model for others in his organization and community,"" Mr. Manfred said. ""Based on my conversation with Mr. Baer, it is clear he regrets what transpired and takes responsibility for his conduct."" The board of the San Francisco Giants, speaking on behalf of the team's ownership, said in a statement that it believed the discipline imposed by the commissioner was appropriate. The team said that its acting chief executive, Rob Dean, would serve as the interim ""control person"" until it designates someone permanently. Mr. Baer, who in addition to leading the Giants' executive office is one of the team's principal owners, will continue to serve as the team's chief executive and president after he returns from his suspension, the team added. ""I respect and accept the commissioner's decision,"" Mr. Baer said in his own statement. ""I made a serious mistake that I sincerely regret and I am truly sorry for my actions.""

The punishment came as the sports world waits to see how the N.F.L.'s commissioner will reprimand the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert K. Kraft, who has been accused of soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla. Mr. Kraft pleaded not guilty to two first-degree misdemeanor charges late last month. The situation involving Mr. Baer and the allegations against Mr. Kraft have drawn attention to how team owners and executives are punished after being accused of misconduct, compared with players, for whom fines and suspensions may carry a greater impact. After video of the encounter, which was first posted by TMZ Sports, surfaced publicly this month, Mr. Baer and his wife, Pam, initially issued statements denying that a physical altercation had taken place. The video appeared to show them arguing in a public plaza. Ms. Baer sat in a chair, and her husband stood next to her. And then Mr. Baer was seen lunging toward her, grabbing her and setting off the struggle, during which she fell to the ground and screamed, ""Oh my God!"" The police and Major League Baseball quickly pledged to investigate what had taken place and Mr. Baer apologized. Three days after the confrontation, the Giants announced that Mr. Baer would take a leave of absence from his job as chief executive. In mid-March, a coalition of women's groups posted an open letter online that called on Mr. Manfred to commit to ""firm and appropriate action in disciplining"" Mr. Baer. The mayor of San Francisco, London N. Breed, endorsed the call for a serious penalty. After the suspension was announced, the coalition, #DoWhatsRightMLB, said it appreciated Mr. Manfred's reprimand. ""M.L.B. is showing why it is regarded as a leader in advancing cultural change in professional sports by not tolerating violence against women,"" the coalition said in a statement.","Mr. Baer had been on a leave of absence since March 4, days after a video surfaced of him in an altercation with his wife.",0d84a917-9ac9-580b-8f84-7891b0067bbd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/26/sports/26xp-giants/26xp-giants-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=691255562b3d27a21c13dcd831d1a8a82a0c622798fadb35e176ba6a9a31786d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Larry Baer, the chief executive of the San Francisco Giants, has been suspended without pay over a video that shows him in a public altercation with his wife.<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/sports/larry-baer-wife-video.html""><br /></a>",0d84a917-9ac9-580b-8f84-7891b0067bbd,Demo_data/D1_imgs/10d84a917-9ac9-580b-8f84-7891b0067bbd.jpg,9,20
Books,Why 'The Outsiders' Lives On: A Teenage Novel Turns 50,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/12/books/the-outsiders-s-e-hinton-book.html,"TULSA, Okla. -- On a particularly windy day in the Crutchfield neighborhood here, the writer S. E. Hinton was touring the renovations of the future Outsiders House museum. The rundown Craftsman bungalow was where the Curtis brothers -- Darry, Sodapop and Ponyboy -- lived in the 1983 Francis Ford Coppola movie based on Ms. Hinton's book ""The Outsiders."" The book, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this month, was arguably one of the most influential young adult books of its time, and leading this tour was the self-described fanboy Danny O'Connor, 48, who made his own contribution to pop-culture history as a member of the 1990s hip-hop group House of Pain. Mr. O'Connor, who lives in Beverly Hills, Calif., bought the Outsiders House for $15,000 in 2016, determined to turn it into a museum. During the recent tour, Mr. O'Connor was showing Ms. Hinton a first-edition hard cover of ""The Outsiders,"" pointing out a wide paper sash wrapped around the jacket that read in bright orange, ""A remarkable novel about teenagers, for teenagers, by a teenager."" Mr. O'Connor has been on a quest to find artifacts to include in the museum, amassing a collection of memorabilia from the movie, vintage photographs and hard-to-find editions of the book. Next on his search list, he told Ms. Hinton, 68, was a claw-foot tub like the one 18-year-old Rob Lowe (Sodapop Curtis in the movie) stepped out of with just a towel wrapped around his waist.

""All the girls love that scene,"" Mr. O'Connor said. No matter that the book is 50 years old, or that the movie was filmed in this part of town more than three decades ago. Once you're a fan of ""The Outsiders,"" you're always a fan of ""The Outsiders,"" which is why when Mr. O'Connor posted about the tub on Facebook, it was shared over 220 times. Soon there will be a tub.

Since ""The Outsiders"" was first published in 1967, over 15 million copies have been sold. It is a constant on middle-school and high-school reading lists and has been translated into 30 languages. Fanfiction.net counts 8,100 stories based on the book. The hashtag #staygold, which is inspired by a Robert Frost poem that appears in the book, is attached to more than 300,000 Instagram posts. Search the internet for ""stay gold"" and you'll find both the name of a cafe on the Jersey Shore and a Swedish rock band's debut album. Ms. Hinton fields daily questions on Twitter from fans who ask, ""What do you think when people say 'Stay golden' instead of 'Stay gold'?"" (Answer: It makes her cringe.)

That ""The Outsiders"" has permeated the culture so deeply is still somewhat surreal to even Ms. Hinton. ""The rest of my books I wrote, but 'The Outsiders' was meant to be written. I got chosen to write it,"" she said. ""That's the only way I can deal with it."" Ms. Hinton, who still lives in Tulsa, goes by Susie. In 1966, Ms. Hinton's editor, Velma Varner, suggested she use her gender-neutral initials out of concern that her given name, Susan Hinton, would ""throw some of the boy readers off."" She continued to use the initials, even in more recent publications.

When Ms. Hinton was 16, after failing creative writing in her junior year of high school, she wrote ""The Outsiders."" The teacher who failed her was not happy that Ms. Hinton liked to mention this in every interview. She sold the book when she was 17. It was published when she turned 18. It has, quite literally, always been part of her life. For Ms. Hinton, the book is something of a time capsule of her own emotionally driven teenage angst. ""I think that's why it still resonates with teens, because they feel like that,"" she said. ""Your feelings are over the top. You're feeling and seeing injustice, and you're standing up against it."" In ""The Outsiders,"" justice comes by way of class warfare between the greasers, a gang of poor teenage boys, and the Socs, the rich kids from the other side of town. What may be most remarkable about the greasers is their ability to show great affection and emotion despite the masculine-dominated cultural norm of the 1960s. In almost every chapter, someone is crying or on the verge of tears.

""You'd be hard-pressed to find a book where boys are this emotional,"" said Daniel Kraus, books for youth editor at Booklist, a review magazine published by the American Library Association. ""They're crying, they're embracing, they're holding each other in bed."" This adds to the greaser mythology, Mr. Kraus said. Jennifer Buehler, an English education professor at St. Louis University, believes that the greasers' experience, and their need to be seen as human, is similar to what many marginalized groups today are also trying to claim. ""The fact that the character development is so strong in this book plays a crucial part in its power and its enduring relevance,"" she said. While Professor Buehler believes other factors contribute to the book's endurance -- the universal title and the seemingly genderless author -- she credits librarians and teachers for supporting the book from the start. In 1988, an influential award further cemented the canonical status of the book, she said, when it received the first Margaret A. Edwards Award for lifetime achievement in writing for young adults. ""So even though 'The Outsiders' was 21 years old, and the movie had some life, there's something about that literary award from the world of librarians and library service that helped teachers along their way.""",S.E.

Art & Design,"Art Is Becoming a Financial Product, and Blockchain Is Making It Happen",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/arts/art-financialization-blockchain.html,"LONDON -- In recent years, there has been plenty of talk of the ""financialization"" of art. As prices soar to new levels and digital technology opens new markets, that talk is getting louder. Last month in London, DACS, Britain's leading artists' rights management organization, unveiled ""The Art Market 2.0"" to lawmakers in the House of Commons. A report by academics at the Alan Turing Institute in London and Oxford University, it envisioned how blockchain technology might ""change the balance of economic power in the art market"" and ""integrate art into the financial sector."" A financialized Art Market 2.0 would lead to an ""explosion of liquidity and value,"" according to the report. A day later at the London Business School's 10th Art Investment Conference, held at Phillips auction house, there were, as usual, sessions discussing the performance of art as a financial asset class. This year, however, the event focused on whether ""new technologies can make art a better investment.""

But to what extent has the art market been ""financialized,"" in the way that a Wall Street investor would recognize? The lack of liquidity and regulation, together with opacity, volatility, high transaction costs, cyclical trading patterns and a relatively small scale, has long been among the reasons institutional investment houses have shied away from the art market. But wealthy individuals from the world of finance are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about art as a way to increase their capital. ""Much of today's most dynamic wealth creation comes from hedge funds, private equity and real estate,"" said Evan Beard, a national art services executive at U.S. Trust, a wealth management unit of Bank of America. ""None of our clients are buying art for investment. But they're savvy with credit, and art is a capital asset.""

Mr. Beard said that Bank of America has about $6.5 billion of art-secured loans on its books and that clients have used much of this liquidity to capitalize their businesses. Last year in the United States, the art-secured lending market grew 13.3 percent to an estimated $17 billion to $20 billion, according to the 2017 Deloitte Art & Finance Report. The market is dominated by the major investment banks, which charge lower interest rates for their loans than specialist lenders that securitize loans solely against art. And then there is the money that savvy financier-collectors can make out of auction guarantees. Mr. Beard said that more than 10 of his wealthy clients routinely guarantee works at Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips. They take the risk of being the only bidder and owning the artwork in return for a fee or a percentage of the ""overage"" if the bidding exceeds an agreed-upon price. ""They'll guarantee three paintings in a season they'd like to buy and will be happy to own one of them if the overage on the others gives them a good discount,"" Mr. Beard said. At the latest biannual season of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art auctions in New York, Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips took in about $2 billion, a 25 percent increase over the equivalent sales the previous May. Most of the more expensive lots had been certain to find buyers courtesy of these opaque arrangements with third-party guarantors, which blur the boundaries between private and public sales. Among the works sold were paintings by Amedeo Modigliani and Andy Warhol that fetched $157.2 million and $37 million, respectively.

Artnet News pointed out that Christie's website published the price of Andy Warhol's 1963 ""Double Elvis [Ferus Type]"" as $38 million with fees, rather than the $37 million that was announced to the media. That $1 million discrepancy reflected the fee earned by the undisclosed third party, who earned more from the transaction than the seller. That was the casino magnate Steve Wynn, who had bought the painting in 2012 for $37 million. The rewards for saying ""bid"" into a telephone can be even more spectacular. Thomas Danziger, a New York attorney who represents clients active in the top end of the international art market, estimates that whoever guaranteed Leonardo's $450.3 million ""Salvator Mundi"" could have earned between $80 million and $100 million. On the other hand, as Mr. Danziger points out, guarantors who end up buying a work are left wondering if the lot has been overvalued. The Modigliani nude that sold last month, for example, was knocked down to a single bid of $157.2 million from its guarantor. ""Guarantees used to be a gentlemen's club, but now they're greatly extended,"" Mr. Danziger said. ""Auctions have become a public forum for private transactions,"" he added, referring to how it has become routine for at least a third of lots at evening contemporary sales to have been ""presold"" to external guarantors. With plentiful liquidity available from the major banks, and millions to be made from auction guarantees, wealthy collectors can make art a lucrative asset without having to go anywhere near the art finance industry.

One of several start-ups that have explored the idea of ""fractionalizing"" art, Maecenas will divide 49 percent of the value of an artwork into shares, which can then be bought and sold on the company's blockchain trading platform. Shares will initially be priced at $10,000 each, according to Miguel Neumann, one of the company's founding partners, who comes from an investment banking background. The first artwork, Andy Warhol's 1980 silk-screen painting ""14 Small Electric Chairs Reversal Series,"" will be supplied by Dadiani Fine Art, based in the Mayfair district of London. The gallery, which offers a commercial mix of contemporary and older British, American and Russian art, gained notoriety when it became the first in the city to accept payments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. (The Warhol will be valued at 4.2 million pounds, or about $5.6 million.) It remains to be seen how many investors will want to speculate in shares derived from works owned by galleries and collectors. The art market, after all, despite its shortcomings, is still democratic enough that people can buy and actually own works for less than $10,000 that turn out to be good investments. But there are also people, such as Duncan MacDonald-Korth, one of the co-authors of the DACS ""Art Market 2.0"" report, who remain convinced that the technological integrity of blockchain will eventually transform the art market. ""The stakes are getting so high,"" Mr. MacDonald-Korth said in a telephone interview, referring to the skyrocketing amounts being paid for trophy works of art. ""The higher the values get, the more incentive there will be for the market to be properly financialized."" He envisages a large-scale trading platform on which investment banks and hedge funds will be able to trade fractions of art in digital currency. ""We're in a special moment in the economics of the art market."" What this moment will mean for art itself is anyone's guess.",Investors have shied away as an asset class.

Art & Design,A Newcomer in the Paris Art Scene Jostles for Position,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/arts/design/paris-lafayette-anticipations-rem-koolhaas.html,"PARIS -- ""Why would anyone want another art space in Paris?"" the strategy consultant Maria Finders asked as she sat in the winter light of a meeting room in the new Lafayette Anticipations art space here. ""Who wants another corporate foundation?"" These questions confronted Ms. Finders in 2011, when Guillaume Houze, a great-great-grandson of the founder of Galeries Lafayette, the venerable luxury store on the Boulevard Haussmann, asked her to help him develop a new kind of contemporary art foundation. The result, Lafayette Anticipations, will open March 10 in a handsome, late-19th-century industrial building in the Marais -- the city's prime gallery quarter -- that has been radically reconfigured by Rem Koolhaas. The modestly sized arts incubator, performance and exhibition space -- only 450 people will be allowed in the building at a time -- is this Dutch architect's first building project to be realized in the French capital. It will provide working space for the creation of artistic projects, as well as for performances and exhibitions. ""The idea was not to have a jewelry box for showing the collection, but really to have a tool,"" Mr. Houze said in an interview. ""We are focused on trying to help artists, and to give them solutions and the intelligence to help them do their work.""

The Galeries Lafayette already has an exhibition space devoted to art, contemporary fashion and design: the Galerie des Galeries, which opened in the store in 2001. Mr. Houze, 36, an established collector cherished by commercial galleries around the Marais, said his passion for art drew him to engage more deeply. ""In 2011, I convinced my family to further our commitment and to imagine creating a foundation, but actually I had no idea about what we would do,"" he recalled. ""Paris has a lot of institutions and foundations."" There is indeed plenty of competition for the art-loving public's attention. Alongside public institutions like the Pompidou Center and Palais de Tokyo, the city is served by the Cartier Foundation, the Ricard Foundation, and the recently opened Louis Vuitton Foundation and Jerome Seydoux-Pathe Foundation. Next year, the luxury magnate Francois Pinault will open a private museum to showcase his art collection in the central Bourse de Commerce, which sits midway between the Pompidou Center and the Louvre. What Mr. Houze hopes will set Lafayette Anticipations apart will be its provisions for production, with exchanges of ideas across disciplines and the ability to fabricate artworks and spectacles on a massive scale, for exhibition both on and off site. Ahead of the building's completion, well-equipped workshops in the basement were already up and running, assisting in projects destined for the Tate, the New Museum in New York, the Kunsthalle Basel and the Pompidou Center.

Mr. Koolhaas's involvement started in late 2011, when Ms. Finders joined Mr. Koolhaas's firm, the Office for Metropolitan Architecture. She continued her conversations with Mr. Houze and his team, helping them delve further into the connections between Galeries Lafayette and the Paris art world, not just in terms of patronage and investment but in episodes of historical coincidence. ""The department store was born at the same time as the art salon, and the new urban development of Paris,"" Ms. Finders said. The following year, Galeries Lafayette invited the Office for Metropolitan Architecture and its research arm to mount a historical exhibition in the Galerie des Galeries. Together with a team in the Koolhaas firm that included the architect Clement Perisse, Ms. Finders dug into the archives on the ninth floor of the Boulevard Haussmann building. Exploring the family's history was a process Mr. Perisse called ""a sort of mutual psychoanalysis"" between the architects and the Galeries Lafayette group. For Ms. Finders, it was a means, too, of divining how accommodating Mr. Houze and his group might be to radical propositions: ""We needed to know what they could tolerate: What was their breaking point."" Besides Galeries Lafayette's innovations in retail, what stood out in Mr. Perisse and Ms. Finders' study was the store's long heritage of production, from apparel making through contemporary design. This tradition of creating and commissioning became foundational to the art space's identity: The name Lafayette Anticipations was chosen to suggest the start of a process and expectations of things to come. THE GOAL to be a nimble platform for creation has been given rather literal physical form in Mr. Koolhaas and the Office for Metropolitan Architecture's design. A glass box with four movable segments of flooring on vertical tracks now occupies a former courtyard space. These provide adaptable space at the core. The movable parts offer 49 possible configurations to accommodate a range of projects. ""Since it's not about a collection, you couldn't be precise"" about what would be exhibited and how, Mr. Koolhaas said. ""Performance, ballet, theater, music, concerts, digital, video, film: Already, those are extremely diverse and can sometimes have opposite demands. We have to accommodate all of those."" This is not the Office for Metropolitan Architecture's first building with a central elevating platform. In 1998, it unveiled the audacious Maison Bordeaux, a home created for a client in a wheelchair. More radical, perhaps, is the discretion of this project: The architect's intervention is not visible from the street. Mr. Koolhaas, whose firm is responsible for memorable landmarks like the looping CCTV headquarters in Beijing, said there is now a ""total excess in terms of visibility of architecture.""

""So, for me, preservation became a very interesting field,"" he continued, suggesting a new urban paradigm in which architects leave the existing architectural language of the street intact and reimagine those portions that are out of sight. ""I think it's also, in a certain way, an interesting, new, metropolitan style,"" he said, ""old outside but super fresh, new, inside."" The Marais is already home to several buildings that hide contemporary glass boxes behind Haussmannian facades. Many, like the Marian Goodman Gallery, are adapted to accommodate contemporary artworks that grow ever larger, in turn, to fill the outsize exhibition spaces of modern museums and galleries. The hulklike growth is part of a phenomenon Mr. Koolhaas himself once called the ""Tate effect,"" referring to the vast Turbine Hall of Tate Modern in London. While he might not acknowledge it as such, one could view Lafayette Anticipations' production facility as, in part, an architect and a collector's solution to an architect- and collector-generated problem: a way to help artists tasked with filling enormous gallery spaces beyond the practical scope of an individual. LAFAYETTE ANTICIPATIONS itself is of relatively modest dimensions, with 9,400 square feet of exhibition space -- less than a quarter of the Louis Vuitton Foundation's. It reflects Mr. Houze's positioning of his institution ""on the side"" of Paris's new art ecosystem. Unlike the huge crowds that attend the Palais de Tokyo openings, Lafayette looks to keep its audiences small and focused.

Asked how he might judge success, if not by audience size, Lafayette Anticipations' managing director, Francois Quintin, suggested it might come from the liberated quality that emerges when commercial imperatives are removed. In Paris, as in London and New York, the cost of living puts pressure on artists to create work that can be sold. Rising rents have driven artist-run spaces out of the city center and fomented the closing of smaller independent galleries. Lafayette Anticipations ""was not conceived to be an alternative, but of course it is,"" Mr. Quintin said. ""Sometimes we are able to produce things that neither galleries nor museums are able or wanted to produce."" Working with three associate curators in programming the art space, among them Charles Aubin of Performa in New York, Mr. Quintin is setting his sights on the international as well as the local scene. The only common criterion that he seeks in artists to work with is ""intelligence"": bright minds for a bright new space. It's too soon to say what the impact will be on the Paris scene. Perhaps for this reason, Lafayette Anticipations' future has been left open: Only two shows have been scheduled, including the opening exhibition, a site-specific installation by the New York artist Lutz Bacher. ""I have an image of where the foundation could be in 25 years,"" Mr. Quintin said, smiling. ""But I have no idea of what we're going to do in two.""","Lafayette Anticipations, a Rem Koolhaas-designed center for experimental art, joins a crowded field of corporate-funded institutions.",22b49eb6-08a2-5088-bf20-032e608cc1f0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/04/arts/04LAFAYETTE-01/04LAFAYETTE-01-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=dfae6562d7129f9787635ce317ef2146ef9582767a4e7bb96b9e955f2a65998d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The architect Rem Koolhaas in the renovated building that houses Lafayette Anticipations, a production, innovation and exhibition hub funded by Fondation Galeries Lafayette, in the Marais district of Paris.",22b49eb6-08a2-5088-bf20-032e608cc1f0,Demo_data/D1_imgs/122b49eb6-08a2-5088-bf20-032e608cc1f0.jpg,14,14
Books,The Civil Rights Movement Photographer Who Was Also an F.B.I. Informant,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/books/review/preston-lauterbach-bluff-city.html,"When Ernest Withers was a press photographer in Memphis in the mid-1950s, he put a slogan on his business cards: PICTURES TELL THE STORY. Indeed they did. He was no effete aesthete; he was a working reporter, one whose job was to get there, get in close, get the powerful shot and (if all went well) get paid. He was African-American, often publishing in The Chicago Defender and Jet magazine; drawn toward the biggest story around, he was soon covering the civil rights movement. And because he was good at his job, those pictures have vigor and punch. At the trial of Emmett Till's murderers, he defied a judge's no-cameras order and got off one quick, sharp frame as an accuser fingered one of the killers. He hung around a local blues club and photographed the rising star Elvis Presley as he soaked up the local musical culture he later reinterpreted for the rest of the world. He was with Martin Luther King Jr. aboard one of the first integrated bus rides in Montgomery, Ala., in 1956, and he was there when King lay in a funeral home in 1968.

Which made it all the more astounding when, a few years after his death in 2007, the truth came out. Starting in the early 1960s, Withers had spent nearly two decades as a paid informant of the F.B.I., feeding its agents information about the activists he photographed. He not only informed; he took requests. At one anti-Vietnam War march, he was asked to photograph all of the 30-odd protesters, taking special care to catch all their faces, and he turned 80 8-by-10 prints over to his F.B.I. contact. On occasion, he sold his work to a local paper, then gave copies to the bureau. His daughter Rosalind, the youngest of his nine children and the one who handles his estate, was blindsided when the news came out via a series of FOIA requests and legal fights undertaken by Marc Perrusquia, a reporter from The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. Perrusquia wrote about Withers and the revelation of his intelligence work in his own book, ""A Spy in Canaan,"" which was published last year. It's a smart journalist's book, crisply marching through Withers's F.B.I. records and the paper's battle to pry them out of the government's grip. ""Bluff City,"" by Preston Lauterbach, aims instead for something less snappy and more lyrical. Its subtitle is ""The Secret Life of Photographer Ernest Withers,"" which suggests that it's a biography, but it isn't quite that, or at least not a comprehensive one. Big stretches of Withers's life get a fairly cursory look, and Lauterbach basically calls it a day after King's assassination in 1968, dispatching the photographer's subsequent four decades in an introductory chapter and an afterword. Nor is this a book about photography history, examining the photographs the way an art historian might. There are 18 pictures, most, though not all, by Withers, enough to hit the main points but no more. (Which is fine. Decisions about including photos in a book like this tend to be limited by the cost of rights, and anyway there are several nice volumes of Withers's pictures out there. Or, you know, Google.) Instead what Lauterbach, a former Memphis resident and the author of two other books set in the South, ""Beale Street Dynasty"" and ""The Chitlin' Circuit,"" is going for is a loose, rangy history of the civil rights movement in Memphis, using Withers and his camera as the (literal) lens. He's done the work, tracking the complex, intertwined dances of the radicals and the centrists, the local ministers and visiting heavyweights like King. Weirdly, though, his very thoroughness and deep interest in this time and place have the almost certainly unintended effect of diminishing Withers rather than keeping him front and center. There are long stretches where, say, Stokely Carmichael appears, and we get 10 enthusiastic pages about his politics and S.N.C.C. and the dynamics between Carmichael and King, and then Withers pokes his head in to snap a few pictures and go meet his F.B.I. contact. Some of those scenes are nicely wrought, but the secrets in this life are often other people's rather than Withers's own.

The narrative tightens up and gains momentum as it builds toward that deadly evening at the Lorraine Motel. Much of the book is structured around the final days of King's life, as he tried to manage a sanitation strike in Memphis that turned violent, leaving him dejected. That was the protest at which Withers shot his best-known photo, of a line of strikers bearing signs that read I AM A MAN. The men are carrying the signs on sticks that Withers himself helped saw, and when the march turned violent, those pine two-by-twos became weapons. (Lauterbach expends some energy trying to figure out whether Withers had supplied them in hopes of creating a stir.) A week later, Withers was not on the scene when King was shot, although he arrived shortly after. Those famous pictures of King's associates, pointing toward the direction of the rifle shot? Withers didn't take them, but the young South African photographer who did, Joseph Louw, was too rattled to develop them himself, and nearly botched the processing. Withers stepped into the darkroom alongside him and made sure it got done right. The central question a reader is likely to ask of this book (and of Perrusquia's as well) is: Why did a man whose life and work were knitted into the civil rights movement feed information to J. Edgar Hoover? The F.B.I. director's explicit goals, after all, were to disrupt all the organizing, to drain the movement's influence, to humiliate and destroy King. Lauterbach has a few theories, and all are probably true to varying degrees. For one thing, Withers needed the money. He raised his big family on a freelance photographer's pay, and put most of his kids through college. (Some civil rights activists from the era say that, since they were operating in the open, Withers was not betraying them but simply conning the F.B.I. for some cash.) For another, he disliked the anti-American language on the fringier end of the left, especially when it turned communistic. He was preternaturally inclined toward a law-and-order point of view. In fact, he'd been a cop before he was a photographer, and a crooked one at that. In the early 1950s, he left the Memphis Police Department involuntarily, after he'd been caught selling illegal liquor under the table. Twenty-four years later, he was appointed to the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board -- and then was stung again, this time by the F.B.I. itself, as he worked a scheme to get a prisoner out of jail in exchange for a cash payment to the governor. ""Bluff City"" may not get to Withers's inner life, but it is not without pleasure. Lauterbach is justifiably sympathetic to his subject, noting that one has to be generous about judging the things a black man in the Jim Crow South did to get by. (Withers was beaten during at least one march he covered.) And Lauterbach likes the other central character in the book even better, that being Memphis itself. In his first chapter, he describes a day in 2005 when he dropped by Withers's studio for a tour and got a lift home from the photographer in that old sedan. ""He drove -- in a manner many people familiar with Memphis will recognize -- slowly, drifting right."" That kind of describes his book, too.","""Bluff City,"" by Preston Lauterbach, delves into the double life of Ernest Withers, one of the era's great documentarians.",1aedc2a0-1efa-5d78-97c8-250082eab35c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/20/books/review/20Bonanos1/20Bonanos1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=441af8dfe40dc0404d5f615c1e18f2253c073b40eb90ec634dd5bfb7b3a885db&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Ernest Withers's photograph of a march in Memphis in 1968 after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.,1aedc2a0-1efa-5d78-97c8-250082eab35c,Demo_data/D1_imgs/11aedc2a0-1efa-5d78-97c8-250082eab35c.jpg,13,20
Health,Child Safety Measures for Packaging of Laundry Pods Are Approved,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/health/to-deter-poisoning-of-children-safety-measures-for-packaging-of-laundry-pods-are-approved.html,"Every year, increasing numbers of children eat or inhale the contents of brightly colored packets of laundry detergent that they mistake for candy or teething toys. On Tuesday, the first safety standard for packaging and labeling so-called laundry pods was approved by A.S.T.M. International, an organization that helps establish product standards. The recommendations were negotiated over the past year by a group of industry representatives, consumer and medical groups and officials from the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission. Richard Sedlak, the executive vice president of technical affairs at the American Cleaning Institute, an industry group, said the recommendations would greatly reduce the frequency of childhood poisonings by laundry pods.

But adherence to the new packaging standard is not mandatory, and it was not immediately clear when manufacturers would begin to redesign their products. ""I don't know if it will stop children from being poisoned by these products,"" said Elliot F. Kaye, chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Still, he added, ""The creation of a standard that has these elements is better than the lack of one, no doubt about that."" In 2014, 11,862 children younger than 6 ingested or inhaled the contents of laundry packets, up from 10,273 in 2013, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers. The tally for the first eight months of 2015 was 8,428, roughly 500 more than during the same period last year. At that pace, the number of accidents this year will be the highest on record. In July, Consumer Reports stopped recommending laundry pods or packets ""until the adoption of tougher safety measures leads to a meaningful drop in injuries.""

The new standard approved by A.S.T.M., the American Society for Testing and Materials, calls for manufacturers to add a bitter taste to the soluble film encasing the detergent to deter children from putting the pods in their mouths, and to make the film take longer to dissolve once wet.

The recommendations also include options for making containers harder for curious toddlers to open -- for example, closures that require dexterity or strength. The standards group also urged manufacturers to use opaque containers (some companies already do) so children cannot see the pods, with warning labels placed on the front and back. Dr. Frederick M. Henretig, an emergency medicine doctor and the senior toxicologist at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the idea of giving the pods a bitter taste was ""ludicrous."" ""Kids bite into these things almost instantly as they pop them into their mouths,"" he said. But he endorsed the use of packages with a truly child-resistant closure. ""The game is won in keeping it out of the kid's mouth,"" he said. ""Once it goes in, it's game over."" The new packaging standard does not tell manufacturers to reformulate their products to make them less toxic to children, and does not suggest that manufacturers tone down the pods' colorful appearance. ""If you are going to go through the process of making the outer container opaque, why not make the pod itself opaque?"" said Dr. Steven M. Marcus, the executive and medical director at the New Jersey Poison Information & Education System.","The first safety standard for the brightly colored packets of detergent will be voluntary, however.",73d0ad2e-3ec6-50b2-8a56-33b1f388427f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/16/science/16detergent/16detergent-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=b864b903a67bbb690ea72d691f8aeac25ef10419e1eaf624981170a1e144ddb0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Warnings that were among the packaging standard approved for laundry detergent pods.,73d0ad2e-3ec6-50b2-8a56-33b1f388427f,Demo_data/D1_imgs/173d0ad2e-3ec6-50b2-8a56-33b1f388427f.jpg,1,7
Sports,Canada Withdraws From Summer Olympics as I.O.C. Weighs Postponement,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/sports/olympics/summer-olympics-tokyo-postpone.html,"The International Olympic Committee, faced with mounting pressure to postpone the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, said on Sunday that it would decide within four weeks whether to delay or scale down the Games. Yet not long after it announced its timeline, support for having the Games this summer continued to crumble as Canada said it would not send its athletes, Australia told its athletes to prepare for a rescheduling of the event to 2021 and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan acknowledged the Olympics might not go on as planned. ""I couldn't think of cancellation,"" Abe told members of Parliament. But, he added, if it were not possible to hold the Games as scheduled, ""I think we may not have a choice but to make a decision to postpone, putting a priority on athletes."" The I.O.C. statement on Sunday reiterated the position of Thomas Bach, president of the organization, that canceling the Games altogether was not an option and sought to address complaints that the committee had not been transparent in how or when a decision would be made.

""Cancellation is not on the agenda,'' the statement, which was released about 3 a.m. Tokyo time, said. Instead, Bach outlined a delicate balancing act of preserving the Games while facing the reality of the spreading virus. ""On the one hand, there are significant improvements in Japan where the people are warmly welcoming the Olympic flame,"" Bach's statement said. ""This could strengthen the I.O.C.'s confidence in the Japanese hosts that the I.O.C. could, with certain safety restrictions, organize Olympic Games in the country whilst respecting its principle of safeguarding the health of everyone involved. ""On the other hand, there is a dramatic increase in cases and new outbreaks of Covid-19 in different countries on different continents. This led the executive board to the conclusion that the I.O.C. needs to take the next step in its scenario-planning.

Bach added that the I.O.C. was confident it could make a decision ""within the next four weeks."" Later Sunday, he wrote to the athletes, calling on their support and telling them that cancellation would have meant destroying their dreams. A short while before the emergency call, Bach received a letter from Sebastian Coe, the head of track and field, a marquee sport of the Summer Games. In it, Coe, who won four Olympic medals as a middle-distance runner, wrote that it was the unanimous view of the sport's regional leaders that hosting the Games in July as planned ""is neither feasible nor desirable."" ""No one wants to see the Olympic Games postponed, but as I have said publicly, we cannot host the event at all costs, certainly not at the cost of athlete safety, and a decision on the Olympic Games may become very obvious very quickly,"" Coe wrote. ""I believe that time has come and we owe to our athletes to give them respite where we can. And in this matter, I believe we can."" And late Sunday, the Canadian Olympic Committee and Canadian Paralympic Committee said that they would not send their athletes to Tokyo in the summer of 2020, and hoped that the Games would be postponed for one year. The committees also voiced their approval for the I.O.C.'s decision to not cancel the Games. Australia in its statement said, ""It's clear the Games can't be held in July. Our athletes have been magnificent in their positive attitude to training and preparing, but the stress and uncertainty has been extremely challenging for them. A year's postponement may hit track hard. It would most likely require it to reschedule its world championships, the first to be staged in the United States.

The announced time frame did not placate some Olympic athletes and leaders. Hugh Robertson, chairman of the British Olympic Association, said four weeks was likely too long to wait. ""We urge rapid decision-making for the sake of athletes who still face significant uncertainty,"" Robertson said. ""Restrictions now in place have removed the ability of athletes to compete on a level playing field, and it simply does not seem appropriate to continue on the present course toward the Olympic Games in the current environment."" Christian Taylor, a two-time defending gold medalist in the Olympic triple jump and the leader of the Athletics Association, a labor group that provides a greater voice to the world's track and field athletes, also said that four weeks was too long to wait. His group has been conducting a survey of its members and has received 4,000 responses. Over all, 72 percent said the Olympics should not go on as planned, and 78 percent voted in favor of a postponement. In addition, 87 percent said their training had been compromised.

Norway's Olympic committee, in a statement on Friday, became the first to state a clear preference for the Games to be delayed until the global pandemic can be brought under control. The Brazilian Olympic committee on Saturday endorsed postponing the Games until 2021. U.S.A. Swimming and U.S.A. Track & Field, the governing bodies for those sports in the United States, have called for a one-year delay. Together, those sports typically account for most of the United States' medals. An athletes' rebellion has also been brewing. Several have spoken out recently, notably Hayley Wickenheiser, a member of the I.O.C.'s athletes' commission. Wickenheiser, a doctor and five-time Olympian, described efforts to press on with plans for the Games amid a global health crisis as ""insensitive and irresponsible."" The I.O.C. leadership was shocked by the scale of the impact the virus has had on large parts of Europe, with Italy now surpassing China for the number of dead, and casualty figures in neighboring countries growing rapidly by the day. In his most recent public comments on the decision, Bach on Thursday backed off his previous hard line that the Games would happen this July. ""Of course we are considering different scenarios,"" Bach said. ""But we are contrary to many other sports organizations or professional leagues in that we are four and a half months away from the Games. They are even more optimistic than we are, because most of them have postponed their events until April or the end of May. We are talking about the end of July."" Although the Olympics may not begin for four months, sponsors, fans, athletes and national Olympic committees have to make decisions and commitments now. Sponsors, who pay $25 million a year or more to be affiliated with the Games, are finalizing hundreds of millions of dollars of advertising and promotional expenses, as well as travel and hospitality for thousands of employees and guests they plan to take to the Games.

Ricardo Fort, the head of global sponsorships for Coca-Cola, the oldest sponsor of the Olympics, with an unbroken partnership since 1928, wrote on Twitter: ""The IOC is taking the right steps to proper evaluate their options. Whatever decision they make, it will be based on facts (and not on the pressure of any one Federation in any one country, no matter the Federation or the country)."" The comments from some of the national federations calling for a pause to the Games are said to have infuriated and surprised some at the I.O.C., not least because they did not raise them at a video conference meeting with Bach on Tuesday. Brian Lewis, who heads Trinidad and Tobago's Olympic body, was the only one to put forward the suggestion of postponing the Olympics. But, Lewis said, Bach placated him by saying the I.O.C.'s management of the situation was in line with advice from health experts, including the World Health Organization. In recent days, athletes, including many unable to train because of measures put in place to tackle the spread of the virus, have called for the I.O.C. to decide, sooner rather than later, whether the Games will be delayed and for how long. ""So many people feel that if there was an answer then we would know what to do,"" said Kathleen Baker, a gold and silver medalist in swimming at the 2016 Olympics.","Faced with growing frustration from athletes and some national committees, the International Olympic Committee said it would decide within four weeks on the Tokyo Games.",195847f5-fdc5-50d6-bba2-38974a68261a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/22/sports/22virus-ioc-SUB/merlin_170755266_3ceed603-0966-4a77-a265-9d37eb3e592d-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=7e7718bf8702596ce527a21a1a9c5a598d41a4fab90234c239fb7b45dfd1095b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Thomas Bach, the I.O.C. president, has said that canceling the Tokyo Games is not an option.",195847f5-fdc5-50d6-bba2-38974a68261a,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1195847f5-fdc5-50d6-bba2-38974a68261a.jpg,9,20
Style,Gen Zers Say Silicon Valley Is Elitist and Exclusive. Can They Build a New System?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/style/gen-z-tech-mafia.html,"Gen Zers Say Silicon Valley Is Elitist and Exclusive. Can They Build a New System?

For young people, breaking into the cutthroat tech industry -- or any industry, really -- has become far more difficult during the pandemic. In-person networking events and club meetings are on hold; there aren't many online hubs for informal connection; and the investors and founders whose buy-in can make or break a product are harder to reach. In late July, Emma Salinas, a 20-year-old designer and engineer in San Francisco, and her friend Carson Poole, 21, a founder of an artificial intelligence start-up, decided it was time to do something about it. Ms. Salinas set up a server on the messaging platform Discord called Gen Z Mafia (riffing on the PayPal Mafia, a set of early employees at the company who went on to become industry leaders), to communicate and connect with other young people seeking to break into the industry. Within weeks, hundreds of people had joined, including high school students, college-aged founders, and young employees at major tech companies. Together, the server's members are collaborating, networking and building products that they hope will shape the future. Long Tran, 17, built a tool to help protect people from harassment on Twitter. Snigdha Roy, 16, is attempting to use machine learning to create an A.I. therapist. Several Gen Z Mafia members built vibes.fyi, an online bulletin board aimed at spreading positivity. Another project, called Cloakview.ai, is an effort to build technology to outsmart Clearview AI's facial recognition system. It is currently in development.

The group was founded as a kind of counterpoint to the Silicon Valley establishment, which its members say is exclusive, elitist and riddled with systemic problems including sexism, ageism and racism. Rather than reinforcing norms and kowtowing to the most prominent and outspoken V.C.s on Twitter, Gen Z Mafia members have tried to cultivate an environment that feels inclusive and aligned with their values. Several partners and limited partners at old-school funds -- whom Mafia members refer to jokingly as ""daddies"" -- are on the server, but their access to most of the content is restricted. Anyone over the age of 24 is placed into a group called Daddy Gang and limited to only a few channels. ""We wanted to provide an intimate space where people could send memes and be themselves and not be scared to say something because the V.C.s are there,"" said Sudarshan Sridharan, 20, a founder of the group. ""They've got a lot of money though, and we want them to give it to people in the group.""

Sahil Lavingia, an entrepreneur turned investor, said he hopes to serve as a ""cool uncle"" for the next generation of tech leaders. ""They can ask for help, but I'm not going to tell them how to live their life,"" Mr. Lavingia, 28, said. ""I'm a visitor in this space, and I'm not there to tell them what to do or how they should implement community in this new era."" There is an application form to join, but the group's founders say it's a formality. ""Gen Z Mafia is a very inclusive community,"" Mr. Tran said, adding that the server's users ""have different political views but we try not to stomp on each other."" ""One of the greatest parts of our group is how many ways we support each other,"" said Johnny Dallas, 18, an engineer at Amazon. ""We all beta each other's products, upvote every Product Hunt post, teach each other our expertise and take any opportunity to use each others' products.""

The group has a laid-back, playful vibe. Its most senior members are known as ""the Ministry of Building,"" a play on a recent post by the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen titled ""It's time to build."" Other channels include Unicorn Factory, for discussing big ideas and potential start-up plans, and Hell Chat, for posting jokes. Members have also built spaces for different interests like Minecraft, memes, fashion, gaming, crypto and YouTube. Ms. Salinas said the group is seeking to recruit women and people from marginalized backgrounds who haven't always been recognized by the Silicon Valley elite. ""We're looking for outsiders because they need this the most,"" she said.

Brianne Kimmel, 32, the founder of Worklife VC and a member of the server, said she wasn't surprised to see Gen Zers banding together to contend with an industry that they feel has misunderstood them. ""There's an eagerness from V.C.s to claim they understand Gen Z, but I've not been impressed with any V.C.'s ability to listen or take Gen Z seriously,"" said Ms. Kimmel. Their approach, she said, is ""more about tracking macro trends and how Gen Z are consuming or creating media, and less about understanding why they're actually creating what they're creating."" But building a new system means eschewing the tech establishment; some of the group's leaders still hero-worship many of the industry's powerful and divisive leaders, such as Elon Musk and Mr. Andreessen, a fact some members take issue with. Gen Z Mafia has faced criticism for myriad missteps, many of them misogynistic in nature. Early on, members could award each other a digital currency called ""wives."" ""We took it down immediately, as soon as we realized,"" Ms. Salinas said. ""The only currency we have now is emojis.""

Fiona Carty, 22, a designer in San Francisco, and early member of Gen Z Mafia said that she was disappointed by sexist behavior and statements made by Mr. Sridharan on Twitter and elsewhere. ""I've tried to give him a lot of empathy,"" she said. ""There's things he'll say that are not politically correct and inclusive and insensitive."" ""I think we're all learning and growing every day. I'm doing my best to try to become the best person I can be,"" said Mr. Sridharan. ""We have a zero-tolerance policy toward noninclusive behavior, anyone, including the founders, who doesn't comply with that will be banned from the community,"" said Ms. Salinas. Gen Z Mafia is part of a larger movement of young people looking to challenge the tech establishment. In June, a group called Eye Mouth Eye was responsible for a stunt product that leveraged exclusivity and hype culture around invite-only apps to get wealthy V.C.s to donate money to Black Lives Matter. ""With Eye Mouth Eye, our core beliefs are we don't do things for profit, we don't try to grift off things and we put our energy toward projects for the greater good,"" Ms. Carty said. ""We're not trying to take V.C. funding, we're trying to use our skills to help people. I think Gen Z Mafia does do that to some degree. But Gen Z Mafia, they do worship the establishment."" In the coming months, the group's members plan to form a syndicate or angel fund to invest in community members' projects. (Mr. Sridharan said the group hoped to raise money from tech investors and TikTok stars.) They view the server as an incubator for ideas and hope to see companies formed as a result of those discussions. ""I can't exactly explain why, but there's some sort of energy that I see within Gen Z,"" said Ms. Salinas. ""I want other young people to know they're not alone in wanting to build a lot of things and having these visions and dreams and wanting to change the world.""",A group of young tech enthusiasts are carving their own path on Discord.,d8412689-456b-5061-9e02-7fb9965ec9d1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/17/fashion/14GENZ-TECH-MAFIA3/14GENZ-TECH-MAFIA3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2f952efc788bc3cf83968ba57313509c6788b7ba5088b829111ac82803147230&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Emma Salinas, a 20-year-old designer in San Francisco, set up a Discord server called Gen Z Mafia where young people in tech can discuss ideas and collaborate.",d8412689-456b-5061-9e02-7fb9965ec9d1,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1d8412689-456b-5061-9e02-7fb9965ec9d1.jpg,15,20
Travel,"At the Boxotel in Montreal, Life Is Lofty",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/travel/boxotel-montreal-hotel.html,"Rooms start at about 165 Canadian dollars (about $131 at 80 cents to the U.S. dollar).

For her first hotel project, the Montreal property developer Marie-Jeanne Rivard wanted to mix the coziness of homestays, the services of a hotel and the downtown feel of loft living. The result, open since last winter, is something new for Montreal: Twenty high-ceilinged, clean-lined rooms equipped like small apartments, complete with top-end appliances, tableware and cutlery. Abstract photomontages of Montreal street life adorn the whitewashed walls. A sleek aesthetic extends through Boxotel's airy, poured-concrete lobby and to 175B, a subterranean gallery showcasing Quebec and Canadian artists. On Boxotel's sixth floor, a tiny gym and sauna open to a sprawling outdoor terrace with panoramic downtown views. A reality-TV star in Quebec -- she renovates and sells homes on the hit show ""Flip a Fille"" -- Ms. Rivard often checks guests in herself at Boxotel's tiny front desk, called ""The Box Office.""

With shabby residential buildings nearby, Boxotel's block can feel bleak. But its Ontario Street location, a five-minute stroll from buzzy Blvd. St-Laurent to the east and the Quartiers des Spectacles zone of cultural attractions just south, makes Boxotel an ideal home base.",The lobby is poured concrete.

Theater,Review: 'David's Friend' Dances Through New York's Disco Nights,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/theater/davids-friend-review.html,"Watching ""David's Friend,"" a feisty and funny one-woman show written and performed by Nora Burns, is a bit like sitting down, slightly tipsy, and playing a bunch of your scratched but beloved 45s from the late 1970s and early 1980s on your record player -- if you've kept yours or joined the blooming back-to-vinyl movement.

Although its focus is the story of her fast (in all senses) friendship with the man named in the title, whom she met when they were teenagers in Boston, Ms. Burns's show, performed only through Feb. 5 at the Club at La MaMa, is also a heady dip into the years when New York night life was at its dizzying, decadent height; when Bianca and Andy and company were thronging Studio 54 and Xenon and Danceteria; when Details was a magazine printed on unglossy paper and filled with, well, details about anything and everybody that was cool.

If you lived through even a part of it, you'll be swimming merrily alongside her in memories -- although, as Ms. Burns ruefully recalls, many of those wild, unforgettable nights may have been fogged to the point of obscurity by the ingestion of illicit substances. Oh well, clearly for Ms. Burns, it was worth it -- and fortunately she kept a diary.

If you were too young, or too old, or too sensible to partake with the abandon Ms. Burns and her best pal did, her odyssey will bring alive the period and its pleasures (and poisons) with pungent animation. Recalling the story of her and David's raucous years of dancing and drugging until daylight, she says: ""We did not stay home. No one did, you did not stay home, ever.""",Nora Burns's feisty and funny one-woman show recalls those sex-and-drug-filled days of gleefully reckless abandon.,0138862b-7f82-59dc-bbb0-99fe3f0560b1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/30/arts/30DAVIDS/30DAVIDS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=ada47ee5349ec2da38982aec9b424f04b2b2ff4b1057decdb89bda0c2ccbaed4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nora Burns in her solo show ""David's Friend.""",0138862b-7f82-59dc-bbb0-99fe3f0560b1,Demo_data/D1_imgs/10138862b-7f82-59dc-bbb0-99fe3f0560b1.jpg,10,10
Art & Design,Guggenheim's Top Curator Is Out as Inquiry Into Basquiat Show Ends,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/arts/design/guggenheim-investigation-nancy-spector.html,"Ms. Spector said in a statement, ""The Guggenheim is stronger than ever before, and incredibly well-positioned to emerge successfully from the challenges presented by 2020.""

She added that she was ""pleased"" that the independent investigation had ""sought out the facts and confirmed what I have known from the start -- which is that I did not treat the guest curator of 'Basquiat's ""Defacement"": The Untold Story' adversely on the basis of race.""

Ms. LaBouvier wrote on Twitter, ""I was never interviewed for the Guggenheim's Basquiat investigation/did not participate. It was not safe to do so -- a Board member threatened me in May 2019: 'I would not go up against the Guggenheim if I were you,' and did not trust an investigation instigated by said Board."" She declined to comment further but confirmed that she was not interviewed for the investigation.

The Guggenheim said through a spokeswoman that investigators reached out to Ms. LaBouvier multiple times but that she did not respond to their request for an interview. The museum said the investigators had reviewed more than 15,000 documents and conducted interviews with current and former Guggenheim employees and others affiliated with the institution.

The group A Better Guggenheim -- made up of current and former staff members -- said in a statement: ""The Guggenheim's aversion to transparency extended to this investigation. The investigative approach was not shared with employees, and we are aware of staff who bore witness to the harm museum leadership inflicted on LaBouvier who were not contacted by investigators. It is clear the investigation was not as thorough as this matter required.""

Ms. Spector has spent most of her career at the Guggenheim, except for a brief stint as deputy director and chief curator of the Brooklyn Museum that concluded in 2017. She explained her return at the time as ""realizing that it's an opportunity I didn't want to pass up given the number of years I'd already committed to the Guggenheim.""","An independent investigation found no mistreatment of a Black curator, Chaédria LaBouvier, but the chief curator, Nancy Spector, who is white, is leaving after 34 years.",b395e752-9f5d-5473-8691-eac8b787e9c1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/09/arts/08guggenheim1alt/08guggenheim1alt-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=570f8320146ed74af3d21ba414f007251c4e36c2897e11d7f60c5339fca4b2c4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An independent investigation found no evidence that a guest curator, Chaédria LaBouvier, ""was subject to adverse treatment on the basis of her race,"" the Guggenheim Museum announced.",b395e752-9f5d-5473-8691-eac8b787e9c1,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1b395e752-9f5d-5473-8691-eac8b787e9c1.jpg,14,14
Travel,"Bows, Books and Bassoons in London's Marylebone",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/travel/marylebone-london-shopping.html,"V V Rouleaux, on Marylebone Lane in London, advertises ""Fluttery butterflies, couture flowers, gorgeous trims ... and all manner of bits and bobs"" on a hand-painted sign in the stairwell.

LONDON -- A friend once said London is small. He's from Los Angeles. And he's wrong. With nearly nine million people, London is not small, but it can feel that way. It's a city of villages glued together, with nooks and neighborhoods that make it feel scalable, manageable, sometimes even bite-size. Take Marylebone, for example. Stumble out of the Bond Street Tube station and a two-minute walk north will land you in the midst of dozens of specialty shops, each selling its wares as if big-box retailers and online shopping don't exist. The area's elegant pocket of shops and restaurants is wedged between frenetic and frenzied Oxford Street and less-than-quaint Marylebone Road.

Bishop Instruments and Bows (2 Hinde Street) sells heartbreakingly beautiful string instruments. ""By appointment or chance,"" read a plaque by the front door. I took my chances and met Melody Greene, who is in charge of accounting at the shop. The violins were lined up in glass cases, cellos upright by the front window. ""It does seem very village-y,"" she said of Marylebone. ""All the people in the bank know you by name.""

Nearby is Paul Rothe & Son (35 Marylebone Lane), which brands itself as a deli but seems more of a jam shop, still going strong in its 117th year. Behind the counter, Paul Rothe worked alongside his son Stephen (the computer expert). To the left of the shop's door, typed on nine sheets of paper, is the Rothe family history, surprisingly intriguing reading. ""Many people don't know we're here,"" Paul Rothe said, ""while others will travel from 20 miles outside of London just to buy a particular type of jam."" Next stop was VV Rouleaux (102 Marylebone Lane), a veritable paradise of ribbons, lace, trims, flounces and frills. ""Fluttery butterflies, couture flowers, gorgeous trims ... and all manner of bits and bobs,"" advertised a hand-painted sign in the stairwell. Fay Erek, whom I found downstairs in the atelier, told me she could offer millinery services with hats starting around PS150 (nearly $200).

Marylebone High Street offers more of what a Briton might refer to as the ""high street brands"" -- Sweaty Betty (workout clothes), Emma Bridgewater (ultra-British everyday china), Brora (Scottish sweaters). Daunt Books has three levels of volumes, tote bags, cookbooks and greeting cards. And at the northernmost point of Marylebone High Street, a large Conran Shop anchors the end of the neighborhood with modern furniture, chic gifts, books and a dreamy children's section. Heading the other way, it would be wrong not to make a quick stop in La Fromagerie on Moxon Street, if not for the cheese, then for tiny jars of candied violets, lavender essence and other essentials of a well-stocked larder. The Ginger Pig next door allows you to play the role of Oliver Twist, pressing your nose to the glass of a butcher that trades in sausages and meat pies piled high.

Just to the west lies Chiltern Street, where, if you're on the hunt for a wedding dress or a double-reed instrument, you'll find yourself in luck. Chiltern has four bridal boutiques (a fifth, Browns, is just around the corner on Hinde Street), as well as Howarth of London, a woodwind shop with a particular focus on bassoons and oboes, and, for rest and relaxation, Cadenhead's Whisky Shop & Tasting Room.","In the neighborhood, dozens of specialty shops operate as if big-box retailers and online shopping barely exist.",2efae318-831d-5a17-a3d4-4091f19508e8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/27/travel/27LONDON-INYTweb2/27LONDON-INYTweb2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=d7aefef4e2e0b19b27248fa8133a37a20c13d8582d0473d9a6d5a0bcd42c063f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"V V Rouleaux, on Marylebone Lane in London, advertises ""Fluttery butterflies, couture flowers, gorgeous trims … and all manner of bits and bobs"" on a hand-painted sign in the stairwell.",2efae318-831d-5a17-a3d4-4091f19508e8,Demo_data/D1_imgs/12efae318-831d-5a17-a3d4-4091f19508e8.jpg,4,13
Sports,"After Two Rounds, Jordan Spieth Shows No Signs of Rust",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/sports/golf/jordan-spieth-charles-schwab-challenge.html,"FORT WORTH -- Maybe the PGA Tour's three-month layoff was a blessing in disguise for Jordan Spieth. It has been almost three years since he last won a PGA Tour event and almost as long since he's held or shared the lead after 36 holes, but Spieth walked off the Colonial Country Club course on Friday tied for first at 10-under par. His score held to leave him tied in second place at day's end, behind Harold Varner III. Some players were rusty after the layoff. The strongest field in Colonial history took a hit as those who missed the cut included the No. 2 world golfer, Jon Rahm; the fifth-ranked Dustin Johnson; the 17th-ranked Matt Kuchar; the 31st-ranked Kevin Na, the defending champion; and the two-time Colonial winner Phil Mickelson. Once considered the sport's ""next big thing,"" Spieth, 26, posted two rounds of five-under-par 65 to enter the weekend at the Charles Schwab Challenge in contention on one of his favorite courses, which is just a 30-minute drive from his Dallas home. ""I love this place,"" Spieth said. ""It's just a golf course where it forces you to hit to certain areas and play from there, and each pin location has kind of a place you can miss and a place you can't. So, it's just learning it and missing in the correct spots when you're out of position.""

Spieth, who captured two major titles in 2015 and reached No. 1 in the world, had spiraled downward since, primarily because of frustrations from failing to regain his form, to his current ranking of 56th. But his knowledge of the local course put him in position for this grand return this weekend, as he has compensated for ball striking mistakes with creative scrambling around the greens. Starting on the back nine on Friday, he was six under through 11 holes, but then four-putted for double bogey on No. 3 and bogeyed No. 4. The four-putt on No. 3 could have sunk Spieth's resurrection before anyone took notice. But he chalked up the bungled hole to nerves from the three-month layoff. ""I did a really good job of staying very neutral where I'd been kind of getting really negative or down on myself for a little while in the past now,"" Spieth said. ""I felt that I gave myself some grace to say, look, I haven't really been practicing a ton of those kind of short-range putts."" Spieth missed a par putt on the fourth green, but rebounded the rest of the way, birdying the fifth and sixth holes and then managing to pull off two spectacular par saves. After his drive nestled behind a big oak on the seventh hole, Spieth carved his punch shot around the tree, chipped to five feet and made the putt. On the par-3 eighth hole, his ball sailed to the right of the green into a wooded area along the bank of the Trinity River. From that bare spot, just reaching the putting surface would be a call for celebration.

But Spieth threaded a low pitch to avoid trees into the bank of the green, narrowly missing the bunker left. His ball came to rest 4 feet past the hole. He smiled sheepishly as he walked up the hill to the green to join his grinning playing partners, Justin Thomas and Rickie Fowler. Since there were no fans, Fowler provided a soft clap for his friend. Spieth said he told his caddie, Michael Greller, that ""it was a top-10 up-and-down I've ever had, but it may have been a top five on the PGA Tour for me. ""I thought if I hit the green, it would have been phenomenal. After I hit the shot, I just looked and Rickie and Justin were both staring at me, making signs with their backs to the cameras at me like it was pretty ridiculous."" During the three-month layoff because of the coronavirus pandemic, Spieth had ample time to work on his swing without the usual pressures and distractions of tournament golf. He admitted that overthinking had been his biggest nemesis over the last two years and said he relished using the tour's hiatus to free his mind of swing mechanics. ""I tried to approach it as an off-season, knowing that we're going to get pretty busy this fall all the way through really the next fall,"" Spieth said. ""I tried to take some time off from grinding the first month or so, have some fun, and then as things started to open back up, was able to come back and work on different shots."" Regardless of the state of his game, Spieth usually finds a way to contend at Colonial. Spieth's record at ""Hogan's Alley"" features a victory in 2016 and two ties for second among five top-eight finishes. He has finished outside the top 10 only twice in seven starts -- a tie for 14th in 2014 and a tie for 32nd in 2018. His scoring average of 67.79 is the best in tournament history. Spieth was in contention last year, entering the final round two shots behind Na. But Spieth shot 72. He hopes to find himself in a similar scenario on Sunday. After all, that's what he has been training to do for the last three months.",The former top-ranked golfer on the PGA Tour enters the weekend one shot off the lead at the Charles Schwab Challenge.,9a1e7b98-8cdc-5de2-ae48-cbc3fdacc16b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/12/sports/12golf-spieth-1/merlin_173474196_6404ceea-732f-4887-a9a3-cc4bd736c0c4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=b694843c2e5015bdba3047e09e6670946b8b2d31daafe253a842aa0012e316dd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jordan Spieth shot 65 on Friday for the second straight day.

Dance,When Extremes Attract: Dance and Horror's New Pas de Deux,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/arts/dance/dance-and-horror-climax-gaspar-noe.html,"A body holds plenty of space for terror. Here, one of the big dance scenes from Gaspar Noe's ""Climax.""

The director Gaspar Noe is fond of making films in which characters are raped and beaten, or in which a drug trip turns into a journey to hell. They are troubling to the stomach. They hurt the heart. So what does a man who is tickled by such horrors watch for pleasure? ""I'm hypnotized,"" he said in an interview, ""by good dancers."" ""Climax,"" his most recent film, doesn't just have good ones: They are great. But Mr. Noe also throws fear and revulsion into his movie about a party where punch laced -- by whom? -- with LSD is served. A pregnant woman is attacked, brutally. A mother locks her son in an electrical closet to keep him away from the increasingly deranged, drugged dancers. (He might have been better off hanging out with them.) It's fitting that go-for-broke dancing, and the private, messy and passionate lives of dancers, are the conduits that feed Mr. Noe's latest creation. A body holds plenty of space for terror. Like Fred Astaire teaming with Ginger Rogers, dance has found a perfect partner for a new kind of pas de deux: horror. It's a fit. For Mr. Noe -- he is an extreme director, and dance is an extreme art -- a dancer's body has a range of emotions that don't simply land on good or evil.

""Climax"" isn't the only recent movie to match dance with horror. In last year's remake of ""Suspiria,"" by Luca Guadagnino, a dancer finds herself in a modern company that doubles as a coven. (Lots of snapping bones.) The young ballerina in Darren Aronofsky's psychological horror ""Black Swan"" (2010) battles her sanity as she pursues perfection. And even though it doesn't fall neatly into the horror category, last year's ""Red Sparrow"" featured a horrifying moment. Jennifer Lawrence's character breaks her leg during a performance -- with a repulsive crack, her partner lands on it -- which ends her ballet career but not her ballet mind-set. She takes the discipline and rigor of her dance training and applies it to her second career as a spy, notably in the art of seduction. But horror can also be subtle -- and even appear in disguise. In ""The Red Shoes"" (1948), the ballerina Victoria must choose between dance and love. What happens? She dances to her death. It's a sumptuous, beautiful film, but it's also chilling: Dance can make a person lose her propriety, her respectability and even her mind.

While the cinematic approaches are different, there is a common thread: Using the body as a force that steers clear of prettiness in favor of something more primal, raw and even ferocious. Beyond merely dark, it can get abhorrent. Maybe what's happening now in dance-horror is a reaction to things like Damien Chazelle's sunny and sentimental ""La La Land"" (2016), with its earnest, naive dancing that pays awkward homage to the mainstream tradition of the American musical; or the slick dancing of the Fox reality show ""So You Think You Can Dance,"" in which contestants perform choreography that has cheapened the form with its emphasis on tricks and speed. Bring on the witches.

Mr. Noe doesn't watch ballet or contemporary dance; he said he liked Busby Berkeley when he was a child and considers ""Showgirls"" a kind of musical movie. (He's a fan.) But he loves to dance. ""I know it sounds stupid, but I like clubbing,"" he said. ""I like night life in a different way than I like daylight."" He had an epiphany at a vogue ball in Paris in 2017. ""The mood was so incredible in that ballroom,"" he said. ""There were, like, 300 people and no one was drunk, but they were crazy -- shouting and dancing. And at that point, I said, I want to do a movie with these dancers."" The ""Climax"" cast, led by Sofia Boutella -- an actor who got her start as a street performer and danced with Madonna -- is a mix of dancers who specialize in styles like vogueing, waacking and krump. While the film's second half is full of movement in which the performers improvise their psychotic, possessed states as the LSD takes hold, it opens with a spectacular five-minute dance, with choreography by Nina McNeely, set to Cerrone's ""Supernature.""

Giddy and wild, it's an example of order and abandon that says a thing or two about the transcendent joy of dance. Ms. McNeely said she was inspired by the film ""A Chorus Line"" (even though the look is the 1980s, she loves its camerawork) and Bob Fosse's ""The Rich Man's Frug"" from ""Sweet Charity"" (for its big group and patterns). She also knew that Mr. Noe would be using a crane; for one extended sequence, the dance is captured from above, giving it a hint of Busby Berkeley. The first thing Mr. Noe told her was that he wanted to make a movie about energy. ""O.K.,"" she said, with a laugh. ""A little vague. But it was totally true. He loved the dancers who were the most savage and he just wanted it to have a visceral feeling -- like the feeling that you have when you see dancers going crazy at the club.""

Ms. McNeely, a Los Angeles-based choreographer and director who was recommended for the job by Ms. Boutella, a friend -- scrambled to create the opening dance in two days, which is impressive given the nature of street dancers: They're soloists, and they usually they don't work with counts. To break up their solo moments with synchronized choreography, she landed on the most ordinary of movements: walking. In the dance -- which is one continuous shot -- Ms. McNeely uses walking as a way to introduce characters, to serve as a frame around a soloist and, at times, to reveal dancers, almost like a curtain being parted. It gives the dance a clear structure. ""Because of all the different styles, walking became the glue of the piece,"" she said. ""Think about it: That's why people watch runway shows, because walking is awesome just to look at. It's strong."" And it speaks to the way dance and the body are used in the movie. There are no special effects: It's just the body and the beat, and watching it is addictive -- even for Mr. Noe. ""When we go to festivals and I check the sound level before the movie starts, I usually stay so I can watch it over and over,"" he said. ""It's probably my favorite scene in the movie because they're dancing in such different ways, but altogether. You can watch on the right side and you can watch on the left side -- you really discover new things all the time.""","Gaspar Noé's ""Climax"" is the latest movie to push the ecstatic, frightening qualities of dance into horror.

Health,"Personality Change May Be Early Sign of Dementia, Experts Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/health/alzheimers-checklist-mild-behavioral-impairment.html,"""Has the person become agitated, aggressive, irritable, or temperamental?"" the questionnaire asks. ""Does she/he have unrealistic beliefs about her/his power, wealth or skills?"" Or maybe another kind of personality change has happened: ""Does she/he no longer care about anything?"" If the answer is yes to one of these questions -- or others on a new checklist -- and the personality or behavior change has lasted for months, it could indicate a very early stage of dementia, according to a group of neuropsychiatrists and Alzheimer's experts. They are proposing the creation of a new diagnosis: mild behavioral impairment. The idea is to recognize and measure something that some experts say is often overlooked: Sharp changes in mood and behavior may precede the memory and thinking problems of dementia.

""I think we do need something like this,"" said Nina Silverberg, the director of the Alzheimer's Disease Centers program at the National Institute on Aging, who was not involved in creating the checklist or the proposed new diagnosis. ""Most people think of Alzheimer's as primarily a memory disorder, but we do know from years of research that it also can start as a behavioral issue."" Under the proposal, mild behavioral impairment (M.B.I.) would be a clinical designation preceding mild cognitive impairment (M.C.I.), a diagnosis created more than a decade ago to describe people experiencing some cognitive problems but who can still perform most daily functions.

Dr. Zahinoor Ismail, a neuropsychiatrist at the University of Calgary and member of the group proposing the new diagnosis, said studies and anecdotes suggested that emotional and behavioral changes were ""a stealth symptom,"" part of the dementia disease process, not separate from it. Whatever is eroding memory and thinking skills in the dementia process may also affect the brain's systems of emotional regulation and self-control, he said. If two people have mild cognitive impairment, the one with mood or behavior changes develops full-blown dementia faster, he said.

Alzheimer's patients with those symptoms ""do much worse over time;"" after death, autopsies have shown they had more brain damage. Of course, not everyone experiencing mood swings with age is suffering warning signs of dementia. Dr. Ismail emphasized that, to be considered M.B.I., a symptom should have lasted for at least six months and be ""not just a blip in behavior, but a fundamental change."" Still, some experts worry that naming and screening for such an early-stage syndrome might end up categorizing large numbers of people, making some concerned they will develop Alzheimer's when there are not yet effective treatments for the disease. ""There's the potential benefit of early diagnosis, identifying people more likely to decline,"" said Dr. Kenneth Langa, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan. But ""the flip side is overdiagnosis, labeling someone and getting people in the clinical cascade, where you start doing the test and people start doing more brain imaging and being at the doctor's more and getting more concerned.""

""If it becomes a routine practice, that's a huge amount of dollars,"" he added. Dr. Langa, who has written about M.C.I., cited the experience with that designation. Many people given an M.C.I. diagnosis do not develop full-blown dementia even a decade later, and as many as 20 percent have later been deemed cognitively normal, he said. That could be because on the day they were screened, their cognitive function was lower than usual, possibly a result of stress or medications taken for other conditions. ""That's one of the things that makes me think twice"" about creating M.B.I., said Dr. Langa, who recommended the checklist be tested by researchers before doctors began using it. Others are more enthusiastic. ""We have to improve our ability to identify people at risk,"" said Arthur Toga, a neuroscientist at University of Southern California. Eventually ""there will be an effective treatment,"" he said, ""and there's too much unknown about this disease anyway.""

Dr. Toga said his mother, a retired teacher, exhibited frustration and other emotional changes in her 70s, years before she developed Alzheimer's. He believes her moods stemmed from dismay she felt while trying to hide something family members had not yet noticed: ""her ever decreasing cognitive capacity with words."" Indeed, Dr. Langa and others said, memory tests are not always able to detect early problems because some people, especially highly educated ones, may be skilled enough at taking tests that their scores do not reflect the full extent of their cognitive slippage. Dr. Mary Ganguli, a professor of psychiatry, neurology and epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh, said people often came in reporting that they or a family member had stopped doing something they always enjoyed, like baking a certain Thanksgiving dessert or tinkering with the lawn mower in springtime.

Even the patient may not know why, she said. They may be uninterested in the activity because ""they couldn't figure out how to do it anymore."" Usually, when Dr. Ganguli asks if the patient is having trouble remembering things, ""They will say, 'Yes, but it's not the biggest problem,'"" she said. ""But if I assess them, I find memory problems."" Some experts supporting the new diagnosis said that unlike most cognitive problems, some mood and behavior symptoms could be treated with therapy and medication. ""We can make them sleep better, we can take the edge off depression, we can help the family learn how to manage the problems,"" Dr. Ganguli said. Dr. Ismail said apathy was a common symptom, but he has seen starker changes. One patient in her 70s became so sexually uninhibited, she ""went from prude to promiscuous,"" he said. Another, a law-abiding 67-year-old, suddenly ""started smoking crack."" Both later developed dementia. Mood and behavior changes have long been recognized as early-warning signs of frontotemporal dementia, which accounts for about 10 percent of dementias. Palmer Posvar, a patient of Dr. Ganguli's, was in her 50s when she started taking food off other people's plates, asking to borrow money from friends and trying to pawn heirloom jewelry, said her husband, Wesley. At 54, she was found to have frontotemporal dementia. Now 64, Mrs. Posvar can no longer speak and she falls so frequently that she was recently moved from their house in Fox Chapel, Pa., to a nursing home.","Researchers have proposed new diagnosis, mild behavioral impairment, along with a 34-question checklist to identify people at greater risk for Alzheimer's.",000334b2-f28b-503f-b92f-e358d94a6054,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/26/health/26brain/26brain-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=535&w=1024&s=8cbac78c235f891ab667cfd9866952c7a723f4adca35b1bf55c58e6c1f3fb239&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Amyloid plaques in the brain tissue of a patient who died of Alzheimer's disease.,000334b2-f28b-503f-b92f-e358d94a6054,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1000334b2-f28b-503f-b92f-e358d94a6054.jpg,1,20
Food,"As Mainstays Depart, Charleston Asks Where Its Restaurant Scene Is Headed",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/dining/charleston-restaurants.html,"On Hominy Grill's last day, April 28, customers waited in line for more than an hour. There were plenty of tears and goodbye hugs, like this one between K.J. Nelson and another member of the staff.





As Mainstays Depart, Charleston Asks Where Its Restaurant Scene Is Headed

CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Nathalie Dupree, the doyenne of Southern cooking, sat at a sunny table near the window at Hominy Grill in late April, a few days before it would serve its last biscuit, and insisted on an order of shrimp and okra beignets. Ms. Dupree, 79, also required a plate of curry-scented Country Captain and some shrimp bog, the wetter, milder cousin to Louisiana's jambalaya. She had a waiter bring bowls of lima beans and tomato pudding, then a slice each of coconut cake and buttermilk pie. The dense chocolate pudding with its whipped cream cap had already sold out for the day. But never mind: She had a cup of it stashed in her home not too far away. ""I just don't know who is ever going to make these dishes in this way ever again,"" she said. ""This is the end of something.""

By itself, the closing of a 23-year-old restaurant in a city whose dining culture stretches back to the George Washington administration doesn't signify the death of anything other than a place whose chef and owner, Robert Stehling, 55, was ready to end a good run and move on to something that didn't require as much effort. But Hominy Grill was a seminal place, a bastion of Lowcountry cooking that helped turn this city into a culinary destination. It closed in the same month that the chef Sean Brock officially severed all ties to the restaurants that had vaulted him to national fame, including McCrady's and especially Husk, where he drilled down into the African roots of Southern agriculture and made a religion out of cast-iron cornbread. Mr. Brock opened Husk in 2010 with the swagger of a prizefighter, promising to show that Southern cuisine was the greatest in the world. He came close, leading Southern food into a new chapter begun by Hominy Grill, the original Watershed restaurant in Atlanta, and before them, Highlands Bar & Grill in Birmingham, Ala., and Crook's Corner in Chapel Hill, N.C.

The departures of Mr. Brock and Hominy Grill have turned up the heat on a discussion that was already brewing in Charleston, a jewel-box city built on hospitality and rice culture but also on a brutal history as the nation's capital of the slave trade. At least 100,000 captured Africans passed through Charleston Harbor on their way to being sold as slaves. ""I don't know what the city is right now,"" said B.J. Dennis, a chef whose cooking centers on the Gullah Geechee food traditions developed by West Africans who were enslaved along the southeastern Atlantic coast. His ancestors come from a Gullah Geechee community in Wando, outside Charleston. ""We lost our culinary identity, and I am not just talking about Gullah Geechee but about the whole Lowcountry cuisine,"" Mr. Dennis said. ""The locals of Charleston have been pushed to the wayside, the black locals and the white locals, for this new wave of tourists and people moving here."" He is one of many Charlestonians who complain that the city is crowded with concept restaurants serving $18 cocktails and expensive, mediocre interpretations of Lowcountry standards. ""It's like, let me get some grits and put a million things in it and a bunch of cheese and some duck that doesn't even make sense on the plate, and charge you $30 for it,"" he said. ""Basically, I think we're just a Southern Brooklyn. A Williamsburg.""

When Hominy Grill opened in 1996, the city's Navy base and shipyard was closing. Civic leaders turned with new dedication to tourism. To say they succeeded is an understatement. More than seven million tourists a year crowd Charleston's charming streets, some with homes that date to the early 1700s. Even on a weekday night, the city seems filled with bachelorettes tumbling out of Uber cars, culinary tourists angling for tables and wide-eyed cruise ship passengers, 225,000 of whom arrived in 2018. The feel-good machine doesn't seem to stop. The Charleston Wine & Food Festival, which Ms. Dupree helped start in 2006, packs in 30,000 people each year, and is so popular that NBC's ""Today"" show broadcast live from the event in March. For eight years in a row, the city has topped Conde Nast Traveler's list of the best small American cities. Southern Living readers picked it as the South's best city for 2019. It has held the top spot on Travel & Leisure magazine's best-cities list for six years in a row. As a result, the city is in the middle of the biggest hotel and restaurant boom in its history. The restaurants Mr. Brock once presided over have changed, too, even though the same restaurant group still owns them. Husk has spawned sister restaurants in Greenville, S.C., and Nashville , neither of which he is involved with anymore. McCrady's, a historic restaurant that Mr. Brock helped reinvent in 2006, used to feature dishes like his beet au poivre, in which the vegetable was pressure-cooked, dehydrated and coated in peppercorns so it presented like dry-aged New York strip steak. Now the only beet dish on the menu is a salad dressed in raspberry vinaigrette. Next door at Minero, the Mexican restaurant he started, a sandwich board on the street beckons customers with the promise of tequila and TV, not the nixtamalized masa handmade from heirloom corn. ""You look at the number of restaurants and the amount of people who are coming and the size of the talent pool, and it doesn't add up anymore,"" Mr. Brock said. He is not as concerned as some. ""The great adjustment happening in Charleston isn't necessarily a bad thing,"" he said. ""It will be easier to sift through the ashes and see what's important. What's left will be the thing that moves it forward.""

Still, he and others worry about places like Hannibal's Kitchen, Nana's Seafood & Soul and Martha Lou's Kitchen, small restaurants whose plates of crab rice, steamed garlic blue crabs and fried chicken offer a direct line to the region's Gullah Geechee ancestors. ""We'll be fine without 9,000 Italian restaurants in Charleston,"" Mr. Brock said, ""but we can't take our finger off the pulse of those institutions."" Kenyatta McNeil, the owner of Nana's, has watched the change sweep through the block where his little three-table shop sits. He grew up in a nearby housing project. The neighborhood has gone from mostly black to mostly white, and 75 percent of his customers are now tourists. To bolster business at his and other soul-food institutions in and around downtown Charleston, he started a tour called Geechee Eats Food Shuttle in 2017. It hasn't really taken off, he said. ""The power in Charleston has always been one way and not our way,"" Mr. McNeil said. ""It's all about branding now, and black restaurants in Charleston aren't branding ourselves the way the white restaurants do.""

Tradd Newton, a grandson of the founder of the Piggly Wiggly Carolina Company who owns Tradd's and the seafood restaurant Fleet Landing with his wife, Weesie, doesn't think Charleston is in the middle of a culinary identity crisis. It's just going through a thinning out. That's one reason he decided on a more continental menu for Tradd's. ""There's enough Southern cuisine and enough Southern restaurants that have opened in the last 10 years,"" he said. Yes, he added, there is a wider variety of tourists to contend with. Finding enough qualified employees is a challenge. Parking is awful and rents are high. ""But other cities have grown and thrived and we can, too,"" he said. ""I think everybody's going to be O.K."" Charleston doesn't lack for well-regarded restaurants. The chef Mike Lata continues to show his mastery of seafood at the Ordinary and high-level culinary agility at FIG. Last year, a New York couple opened Tu, serving food from the Indian subcontinent, as a companion to their popular Xiao Bao Biscuit. Coming soon is an outpost of Big Bad Breakfast from the Mississippi chef John Currence, who once cooked at Crook's Corner. Matt Lee, the cookbook author and a resident of Charleston who chronicles Southern food with his brother, Ted, said the city was simply suffering from the kind of adjustments that might come when the most popular student in high school heads off to college. ""The recent closings/openings/'reconceptings' and chef moves are pretty typical for any growing city where there's an extreme staffing shortage and seemingly no end of investor money coming in,"" he wrote in an email. ""Absent any major economic shifts, it appears to be just usual turnover as the restaurant scene and its personnel evolve.""

Back at Hominy Grill, talk around the table was not as upbeat. The city's restaurant game has changed forever, said Nunally Kersh, Mr. Stehling's wife. ""It's not about the chefs anymore,"" she said. ""You can't just come with a dollar and dream."" The two met when they were college kids working for the chef Bill Neal, who opened Crook's Corner in 1982, and is credited with turning the fisherman's breakfast of shrimp and grits into a Southern restaurant standard. The couple moved to New York, where Mr. Stehling spent almost a decade cooking, including at Home in Greenwich Village. In the mid-1990s, Ms. Kersh took a job as the producer of the Spoleto Festival, and they returned to Charleston. Mr. Stehling decided to open a restaurant that would carry on the legacy of Mr. Neal, who died in 1991. Charleston was a place where people understood the style of Southern food Mr. Stehling wanted to cook. ""I didn't want to explain hoppin' John for the rest of my life,"" he said.

Back then, Ms. Kersh and Mr. Stehling could have bought the building for $350,000, but they couldn't afford it. By the time they could, in 2008, it cost $1.8 million. A recent appraisal put its value at $2.5 million, Ms. Kersh said. The neighborhood has been transformed. In the beginning, the staff could walk to work, and customers drove; now it's the other way around. The staff can't afford to live in the area anymore. The conversation about the role food plays in Charleston has changed, too, particularly as the city moves deeper into reckoning with its past. The 2015 murders of nine black parishioners by a young white supremacist laid bare the work left to do.",Hominy Grill has closed. Sean Brock is gone. Tourism and prices are booming.

Art & Design,"At the Berlin Biennale, the Art of Saying 'No'",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/arts/design/berlin-biennale.html,"""Hapana Chitsva,"" a triptych of paintings by Portia Zvavahera at the KW Institute for Contemporary Art, one of the three principal venues for the Berlin Biennial of Contemporary Art.

BERLIN -- In the mid-1990s, when the world began to outsource the production of contemporary art to this ""poor but sexy"" capital, one exhibition in particular underlined Berlin's emergence as Europe's artistic hot spot. The Berlin Biennale, whose first edition took place in 1998, brought droves of artists and curators to the city's dilapidated factories and warehouses, and advocated full throttle for the city's young artists before Germany's museums caught on. Berlin, though, is not what it was in 1998, and neither are biennials. Contemporary art has become one of the city's key marketing tools for the Easyjet-and-Airbnb generation. And biennials are getting more homogeneous: You can encounter as much Berlin-made art in Venice, Istanbul or Taipei as you will here. Now 20 years old, the Berlin Biennale is facing something of an identity crisis, and really cracked up with its catastrophic 2016 edition -- a fashion-fixated parade of narcissistic jokes, complete with posters snickering about fascism outside a former Jewish girls' school. Nothing could be further, at least on the surface, from the last edition's moral clownishness than the 10th Berlin Biennale, led by the South African curator and artist Gabi Ngcobo. It's pleasantly small, with just 46 artists and groups, fewer than half the count of the last edition. This biennial is serious, low-temperature and rather distant; an insider's show, and one that takes almost too much pleasure in saying ""no.""

Ms. Ngcobo first came to international prominence as part of the Johannesburg-based artistic collective known at the Center for Historical Reenactments. A majority of the artists she has invited to this biennial are African or have African heritage, living everywhere from Berlin to New York to Sao Paulo. They are joined by practitioners from Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, New Zealand, and just a few white Europeans. This reversal of ""global"" art exhibitions' usual demographics led many journalists to preview this biennial as a postcolonial endeavor or a lesson in racial justice -- which Ms. Ngcobo and her four fellow curators steadfastly and admirably refuse to deliver. The words ""black"" or ""African"" never appear in the show's introductory wall texts. Racism is evoked only through the oblique phrase ""a willful disregard for complex subjectivities.""

Where the previous Berlin Biennale spewed forth images and pranks, this one withholds -- offering a minimal presentation that evades stereotypes but rarely leaves a mark. It unfolds across three principal venues, the strongest of which, by far, is the Akademie der Kunste art school. Here the young Kenyan photographer Mimi Cherono Ng'ok presents evocative images, some sapped of color and others saturated with it, of flowering plants or a young man gazing out a window. Sara Haq has made dozens of delicate reeds sprout through the wooden floor, in an act of ecological disruption that also has delicate beauty (though its groan-inducing title, ""Trans-plant,"" undercuts its poetry). Two Cuban artists provide historical ballast: Ana Mendieta (1948--85), represented by tender ink drawings of fruit and flowers, and the wonderfully rediscovered artist Belkis Ayon (1967--99), whose large black-and-white monoprints have a ghostly authority. Painting has a significant place in this part of the exhibition, for good and ill. Johanna Unzueta impresses with abstract compositions that draw on the forms of indigenous Chilean textiles. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye contributes half a dozen fictional portraits with, as usual, psychological acuity but overly hasty brushwork.

Ms. Ngcobo refuses to assign these artists any overarching agenda or to articulate any political orientation. Still, politics are not absent, above all in this show's most talked-about work: ""Again,"" a video installation by the German artist Mario Pfeifer that casts a bitter eye on the country's ongoing refugee crisis. In 2016, four men in Germany's eastern state of Saxony dragged an Iraqi refugee out of a supermarket where he was causing a scene and tied him to a tree. Video of the incident went viral, and many Germans defended the men's actions as a selfless act of civil courage. The men faced trial but the case was thrown out, to the jubilation of supporters of the right-wing Alternative for Germany party; the 21-year old refugee, who had a history of mental illness, was found frozen to death in a forest before the trial. Mr. Pfeifer bracingly stages an all-strings-attached re-enactment -- his fictional version fuses Brechtian alienation techniques with the showmanship of trashy German talk shows -- to pick at both the alleged crime and the holes in its media representation. A pseudo-jury of volunteers watches the re-enactment and, like many of the spectators at the biennial, they recoil in horror. ""Would it have happened with a German? I don't know,"" says one. ""Nothing has changed.""

The quality varies more across the five floors of the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art, in the Mitte district. Painting gets welcome attention here too, above all in a commanding triptych by the Zimbabwean artist Portia Zvavahera -- whose ornate layered scenes of a floating bull and bride, as indebted to Klimt and Munch as to southern African printed textiles, are the best work this promising painter has done. Dineo Seshee Bopape, one of many South Africans in this show, fills the museum's largest space with smashed bricks, uncanny orange light, and footage from one of Nina Simone's most chaotic concerts, adding up to a disconcerting tableau of displacement, racism and madness.

Yet much of the art in this part of the show feels underpowered, and that goes double at an unassuming art space in the west of the city, where the show really collapses. Heba Y. Amin films herself as a megalomaniac politician who envisions an African-Asian-European supercontinent; her fantasy appears tasteless when broadcast alongside speeches by real world leaders with actual malign designs. There is figurative work here that barely rises above the undergraduate level: garishly colored portraits by Lydia Hamman and Kaj Osteroth, and fantastical drawings of horned creatures by Tessa Mars more appropriate to a comic convention. Here we run up against the limits of Ms. Ngcobo's anti-totalizing stance: It simply asks too little of artists, and allows her to pass off the most puerile of projects as an act of resistance. In political terms, there's something quite appealing about Ms. Ngcobo's imperiousness, and her steadfast refusal to give a majority-white German audience what it expects. She is right to scupper the art world's expectations that certain artists and curators -- black ones, queer ones, ones from the global South -- must explain themselves, or, worse, teach others how to improve or atone. And in contrast to the fashionista reductions of the previous biennial's curatorial team, Ms. Ngcobo's high-mindedness makes welcome demands on us spectators, who have our own responsibility to look closely, think broadly, and learn our history at global scale. But there is a curious congruence between the smiling nihilism of the 2016 Berlin Biennale and the aloof refusal of this year's: Neither offers enough of a positive vision of what an art exhibition, and what art itself, might actually be for. There's no shortage of outrages to which an artist or curator should say ""No"" -- but ""No"" has to be the beginning of an exhibition like this one, rather than an end in itself. In a round-table discussion printed in the catalog, Ms. Ngcobo quotes Toni Morrison's essential dictum from 1975 about the price of racism: ""It keeps you from doing your work."" All the more reason to celebrate the artists here -- Ms. Zvavahera, with her gloriously agitated paintings; Mr. Pfeifer, with his rigorous and forensic analysis -- who have opted for ambition over retirement.",The South African curator of this year's edition offers no shortage of outrages that artists should refuse. But is that enough for an exhibition?,0ce221e4-3e87-51c6-8658-a91100763c43,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/15/arts/15berlin-biennale1/15berlin-biennale1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=fb4fb8e9d2d2cc73347a2761d673c3ec4a7043e87b54166b11865eeba0030de5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;Hapana Chitsva,&rdquo; a triptych of paintings by Portia Zvavahera at the KW Institute for Contemporary Art, one of the three principal venues for the Berlin Biennial of Contemporary Art.",0ce221e4-3e87-51c6-8658-a91100763c43,Demo_data/D1_imgs/10ce221e4-3e87-51c6-8658-a91100763c43.jpg,14,14
Technology,Congress Asks More Than 80 Companies for Big Tech Complaints,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/technology/house-antitrust-investigation-big-tech.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- House lawmakers have asked more than 80 companies for information about how their businesses may have been harmed by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, according to four people familiar with the requests. The House Judiciary Committee, which is investigating the influence of the tech giants, sent formal requests for information to the companies on Sept. 13. They were asked about their own businesses and how the four tech companies may have engaged in anticompetitive behavior, according to the people who have seen the requests and spoke on the condition of anonymity because the lawmakers asked to keep the letters private. The bipartisan requests from the committee indicated the increasing scope of the congressional investigation into Silicon Valley's power and offered more insight to the pressure Big Tech faces in the coming months. Similar inquiries are underway at the Justice Department, at the Federal Trade Commission and a bipartisan collection of attorneys general from dozens of states.

Lawmakers sent the requests on the same day they asked for scores of documents and personal emails from top executives at the four tech companies, according to the people. All of the companies have until mid-October to respond. The additional letters to more than 80 companies show the breadth of the offensive forming against Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The recipients of the requests range from smaller firms in retail and advertising to large corporations in entertainment, software and social media, the people said. A range of companies, including News Corp., Oracle, Spotify, TripAdvisor and Yelp, have complained about the behavior of the four big tech companies and were likely to have received the requests. It was unclear how the queries to the more than 80 companies are split among the four tech giants. One person familiar with the requests said lawmakers decided against publicizing the requests to protect the complaining companies from potential retribution from the four tech firms -- though those firms have said they do not retaliate against critics. Companies have protested Silicon Valley's growing size and influence for years, but regulators and lawmakers in Washington have sharply increased their focus on Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in recent months.

The House investigation is largely centered on the market power and alleged anticompetitive practices by the four companies. The committee is examining accusations that the big companies favor their own products over rivals, buy smaller firms to head off competition and leverage their size to further cement their dominance. Lawmakers are also scrutinizing how the companies avoid taxes, are used to spread disinformation and handle people's personal information.

Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have said in the past that they face ample competition and do not engage in anticompetitive practices. When asked on Friday about the letter sent to the more than 80 companies, none of the companies offered additional comment. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that House lawmakers had sent requests to some of the tech companies' rivals. The various investigations are just beginning in earnest. How far they will go, what they will uncover and whether any allegations will stand up in court are all uncertain. It is also not clear how the tech companies will defend themselves. On Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, met with President Trump and held discussions on Capitol Hill about election security, privacy and other issues.

Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said on Thursday that it was time for the companies to be more upfront with the public. ""We've had a lot of talk from Facebook, and we have a troubling pattern, when they're up on the Hill, of them saying things that turn out to be either very misleading or at the end of the day it's just not true or they just don't follow through on it,"" Mr. Hawley said. The Department of Justice sent Google a formal request for information this year, and Facebook has acknowledged it is the subject of an antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. When the agencies divided up responsibility for handling competition questions about Silicon Valley this year, the Justice Department also took Apple and the F.T.C. got Amazon. State attorneys general around the country have also banded together to start separate investigations into Google and Facebook. The House Judiciary Committee has held multiple public hearings on the subject of the tech companies' market power as part of its inquiry. It escalated last week when it sent the formal requests to the tech companies and their critics. Representative David Cicilline is the chairman of the subcommittee on antitrust, which is leading the Judiciary Committee's investigation into the influence of Big Tech. In a statement last week, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and the chairman of the subcommittee on antitrust, which is leading the Judiciary Committee's investigation, called the document requests ""an important milestone"" in the fact-gathering stage.","House lawmakers asked the companies for information on how their businesses had been affected by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.",773278a6-6a2c-50f9-8e3a-c5593a82f50a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/20/business/20bigtech2/20bigtech2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f2774456574832fd2500d06c7641008d2681f947cd5b143acdf99378aef96c6d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Thursday.",773278a6-6a2c-50f9-8e3a-c5593a82f50a,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1773278a6-6a2c-50f9-8e3a-c5593a82f50a.jpg,20,20
Dance,Spreading an Ancient Palette in Dimensions Seen and Unseen,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/arts/dance/nivedha-ramalingam-brings-bharatanatyam-to-drive-east.html,"All dance occurs in the three dimensions of space and the fourth of time -- but it can be a beautiful shock to feel the invigorating intensity with which the South Indian classical dance form of Bharatanatyam brings all those dimensions keenly to life. On Monday evening at La MaMa, in one of the opening events of the weeklong Drive East festival of Indian music and dance, the dancer Nivedha Ramalingam stretched to the back of the stage with her right arm, then with her left, each time turning from the front with a 180-degree arc. Likewise she ardently addressed the air above her; next the floor below her; and also the space's various diagonals and horizontals.

Thus her body filled the surrounding box of empty space with tension and energy -- all while maintaining a full-bodied flow of pulsating rhythm to a score featuring percussive vocal syllables. These are among the most basic pleasures of Bharatanatyam, but by any standards they are extraordinary. Ms. Ramalingam delivers them and much more complex aspects with terrific skill. Though the three-dimensionality of ballet is among its assets, and though this year alone I've seen four of the world's five foremost ballet companies, none of them communicate physical multi-directionality with such verve.

Drive East is a New York spinoff of the great annual festival of music and dance in Chennai, India. A season of 40 programs, Drive East includes a concert series, an artists' residency and a summer camp. The performances, at La MaMa, are a first-rate way to deepen our appreciation of India's performing arts.

I've loved Indian dance and music for years, and yet Monday's performances made me feel -- in the happiest way -- how ignorant I am about them. The rhythms of India alone are beyond my grasp, the ways in which form and communication connect are infinitely subtle, and my knowledge of Indian culture and religion is slight; but the sensuous beauty of these arts draws me deep in. It's a good way to feel: as an outsider tumbling into a vast realm of unknown beauty.",Nivedha Ramalingam's performance in the Drive East Festival brings a South Indian dance form to life.,9010bb49-e904-5ad4-9fd9-faa289c6b4a4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/13/arts/dance/13drive-SUB/13drive-SUB-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=674&w=600&s=cd067357b2b34a963fe2c5aa8b11015db2879c22840b4f7e3c10ab96077caa9b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Nivedha Ramalingam  The dancer in her program of the South Indian dance form Bharatanatyam at La MaMa, part of the Drive East festival.",9010bb49-e904-5ad4-9fd9-faa289c6b4a4,Demo_data/D1_imgs/19010bb49-e904-5ad4-9fd9-faa289c6b4a4.jpg,6,6
Dance,"Recollections of Warriors, Redeployed Into Dance",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/05/arts/dance/liz-lermans-healing-wars-at-arena-stage-in-washington.html,"In ""Healing Wars,"" which draws parallels between the American Civil War and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, she incorporates movement, storytelling, music, digital projections -- even flying hospital beds above the stage. Behind is an area that theatergoers will visit en route to their seats and where they will come into contact with characters played by, among others, the actor Bill Pullman; the dancer Tamara Hurwitz Pullman, his wife; and Mr. Hurley, one of several veterans who have contributed their stories in the project's development.

""This has always been part of Liz's thing, that it matters who's doing the performing,"" said Mr. Pullman, whose wife has a long association with Ms. Lerman. ""Whoever is doing the movement brings their own personal richness to it all."" They've brought their own research, too: Mr. Pullman's father was a Navy surgeon in World War II, and he also based his ""Healing Wars"" character on Dr. Richard Jadick, a Navy surgeon in Iraq. Ms. Lerman's father, too, was a World War II veteran. Like many of their generation, neither man talked about his combat experiences. Which is a point of the show.

""When my father was on his deathbed he said, 'Bury me in my uniform,' "" Ms. Lerman said. ""We'd never heard anything about the war, but this was obviously huge to him. And what we find with the vets we've talked to is that once they start talking, they can't stop."" This includes Mr. Hurley, who has tended to run long during rehearsals with the story of his injury -- the result of an attack in Bahrain in 2006, in which a close friend died.

""I kind of get in the moment,"" Mr. Hurley said, ""and watching Bill, I feel he kind of elevates everyone's level. There's a lot of creativity flowing back and forth. He might do something that makes me think of something, and I'll drift off and remember details and have to pull myself back in. But I think we've rehearsed enough where I'm pretty comfortable.""

He may be, but ""Healing Wars,"" whose official opening is next Thursday, was in a semi-amorphous state during a tech rehearsal last week. Across the mostly bare stage -- on which spoken narratives will move back and forth between the Civil War and the present, and alternate with dance -- Keith A. Thompson performed a pas de deux with Mr. Hurley. Ms. Pullman interpreted Clara Barton, the Civil War nurse who went on to found the American Red Cross. The entire company, led by Ted Johnson, danced to Lady Gaga's ""Telephone,"" closely following a projection of a viral 2010 ""Telephone"" video by Aaron Melcher danced by American soldiers in Afghanistan.

Sports,N.C.A.A. Pressures Mississippi on Confederate Emblem on State Flag,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/sports/ncaafootball/ncaa-mississippi-state-flag.html,"Demonstrators waved the Mississippi state flag in front of the governor's mansion in April. The N.C.A.A. warned Friday that the state could lose its chance to host major competitions unless it changes its flag.





ATLANTA -- The National Collegiate Athletic Association effectively warned Mississippi on Friday that it would not hold major competitions there unless the Confederate battle emblem was stripped from the state flag. Under an expanded policy that the association announced Friday, states will not be allowed to host championship events if the battle flag is a prominent, sanctioned symbol. Mississippi is the only state that currently stands to be penalized under the rule, which the association changed during a national outcry over racial injustice. The move by the association, one day after the Southeastern Conference issued its own ultimatum, is certain to place new pressure on state lawmakers and fuel public debate around the 126-year-old flag, the last in the United States with the battle emblem. ""There is no place in college athletics or the world for symbols or acts of discrimination and oppression,"" Michael V. Drake, the chairman of the N.C.A.A.'s Board of Governors and the president of Ohio State, said in a statement. ""We must continually evaluate ways to protect and enhance the championship experience for college athletes. Expanding the Confederate flag policy to all championships is an important step by the N.C.A.A. to further provide a quality experience for all participants and fans.""

The association's shift is a potential landmark in the emotional debate that Mississippi has had for decades, including a referendum in 2001 that showed nearly two-thirds of voters supported keeping the flag that the state adopted in 1894. Although the referendum more or less settled the matter for many elected officials over the years, the revived national scrutiny -- and with it, the threat of economic consequences -- is prompting the state's leaders to reassess their views. That the college sports industry is wielding the hammer is proving particularly influential in a state that cherishes baseball and football. ""A flag's sole purpose is to unite a people around a common cause. Reality has proven clear that the Mississippi flag no longer unites, but divides us unnecessarily,"" Representative Trey Lamar, who played football at Mississippi and became one of the most influential Republican lawmakers in the state, said in a series of tweets on Thursday night.

The most influential universities in the state -- Mississippi, Mississippi State and Southern Mississippi -- have distanced themselves from the flag for years, lowering it on their campuses and pressing officials in public and in private to change it. Mississippi and Mississippi State, which are members of the SEC, said they supported Commissioner Greg Sankey when he said it was ""past time for change to be made to the flag."" Without a new flag, he said, the conference might avoid holding championship events in Mississippi.

Sankey's announcement on Thursday represented an important public relations victory for the flag's critics, who welcomed the statement from one of the South's most prominent institutions. But Friday's change from the N.C.A.A. threatened greater economic peril, in part because Mississippi has benefited from hosting postseason events whose locations are not chosen years in advance. (Some championship event locations are linked to seedings or rankings, not bids by potential host cities.) Just last year, Oxford and Starkville hosted games in the Division I baseball tournament. Starkville was also the site of some games in the Division I women's basketball tournament. ""It's been said -- kind of tongue in cheek, but maybe not so much -- in years past that if they ever said Mississippi State or Ole Miss couldn't hold a regional baseball tournament, you might get some action,"" Greg Snowden, a former legislator who was the second-ranking Republican in the Mississippi House, said in an interview this week. ""There would be teeth if the N.C.A.A. did something."" The N.C.A.A. has penalized states for their use of the battle flag for close to two decades, keeping major events with preselected locations away from places, like Mississippi, where the emblem was officially recognized. Only on Friday did a crucial carve-out vanish -- that states could host championship competitions if their teams' performances earned them a sufficiently high seeding or ranking.

""We must do all we can to ensure that N.C.A.A. actions reflect our commitment to inclusion and support all our student-athletes,"" Mark Emmert, the association's president, said in a statement. ""There can be no place within college sports where any student-athlete is demeaned or unwelcome."" The association has periodically entered other debates in statehouses around the country. In 2016, it forcefully opposed a North Carolina law that curbed the rights of transgender people and relocated some events from the state. This month, the association said that an Idaho law was detrimental to transgender people and in conflict with the N.C.A.A.'s ""core values of inclusivity, respect and the equitable treatment of all individuals."" The Mississippi Legislature is poised to adjourn next week, but state officials could try to move a bill through the Capitol in short order. The Mississippi Constitution also gives Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican who has signaled an openness to changing the flag, the power to convene a special session if he believes ""the public interest requires it."" State officials could also choose to wait until next year to consider the flag's fate.",The association's expanded policy on the Confederate symbol came after the Southeastern Conference urged Mississippi to change its state flag.,77a68f85-1b1a-5f55-9bb3-e0cb3ef2e1b6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/20/sports/19ncaa-mississippi-print/19ncaa-mississippi01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c358bb92a89e794e025ba5e9264cb01e28d3fb1d3fec29bcbc9462d3aaa1cf4a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Demonstrators waved the Mississippi state flag in front of the governor&rsquo;s mansion in April.

Technology,Facebook Says It Is More Aggressively Enforcing Content Rules,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/technology/facebook-content-rules-data.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook, facing withering criticism from governments around the world, said Thursday that it had been more aggressive in recent months about scrubbing its platform of hate speech. In a report the company releases biannually, Facebook also said its automated detection software that scrubs illicit content was improving: It now automatically detects and removes more than half of the hate speech on the platform. Regulators have expressed renewed interest in cracking down on Facebook after a gunman in Christchurch, New Zealand, live-streamed his mass killings on his Facebook account. The video was viewed just 4,000 times before Facebook removed it, but it spread rapidly across the internet and was reposted millions of times. The quick distribution of the video -- and the apparent inability of Facebook and other tech companies to stop it from spreading -- led to calls from regulators who said the company must do a better job of policing the content posted on its platform.

The video prompted government leaders from around the world to sign on to the ""Christchurch Call,"" an agreement to limit violent and extremist content online. Facebook said it would introduce stricter policies for live-streamed videos. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said in a call with reporters that he had recently discussed regulation with President Emmanuel Macron of France and that governments around the world should take a more proactive role in the regulation of online speech. ""If the rules for the internet were being written from scratch today, I don't think people would want private companies to be making so many decisions about speech themselves,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. Facebook said it had removed four million hate-speech posts during the first three months of the year, and detected 65 percent of them with artificial intelligence, up from 24 percent the year before. Its automated systems for detecting violence also improved, Facebook said. It caught 98 percent of the violent content posted on its platform before users reported it. [Get the Bits newsletter for the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.] ""We estimated for every 10,000 times people viewed content on Facebook, 25 views contained content that violated our violence and graphic content policy,"" Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president of integrity, wrote in a blog post.

Facebook is also beginning to use artificial intelligence to detect and remove the sale of guns and drugs from its platform. Gun sales have thrived on Facebook for years, and the company has struggled to prevent them. In the first quarter of 2019, Facebook removed 670,000 posts about firearm sales from its platform and detected almost 70 percent of them without relying on user reports, the company said. ""By catching more violating posts proactively, this technology lets our team focus on spotting the next trends in how bad actors try to skirt our detection,"" Mr. Rosen said. But Facebook's automated detection systems are not foolproof. Mr. Rosen said its numbers for monitoring child exploitation posts were lower this quarter, in part because of a bug that prevented new videos from being added to a database of content that Facebook blocks from being posted. And Facebook sometimes mistakenly removes content that does not violate its policies. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook would establish an independent review board that would double-check its removal decisions. ""This independent oversight board will look at some of our hardest cases, and the decisions it makes will be binding,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said, adding that he and other Facebook executives would not have the power to overrule the oversight board. The social media company also reported a spike in the number of fake accounts, which it said had been caused by large groups of malicious users trying to register for accounts. The company disabled 2.19 billion fake accounts in the first quarter of 2019, up from 1.2 billion in the final quarter of 2018.","The social media company, facing criticism from governments around the world, also offered evidence that its automated systems are improving.",64cdb34e-0145-5734-b5da-8d0e0bb2e246,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/23/business/23facebook1/23facebook1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=65f2612328a300719edbfa6d126c87d5d91b533df4ce8a4fc4108afdff2f2be0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, is being pressured by world leaders to improve how his company polices content.",64cdb34e-0145-5734-b5da-8d0e0bb2e246,Demo_data/D1_imgs/164cdb34e-0145-5734-b5da-8d0e0bb2e246.jpg,20,20
Health,Tanzanian Women Face High Rates of Abortion-Related Deaths,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/health/tanzanian-women-face-high-rates-of-abortion-related-deaths.html,"Unsafe abortions kill many Tanzanian women, according to a recent study, but the deaths result from several factors and women in some regions die much more often than others.

Birth control is hard to get, and public health clinics lack trained staff and vacuum aspiration kits used to perform abortions. In addition, the legality of abortion is ambiguous, forcing many women to try to do it themselves or see illegal abortion providers. Of one million unintended pregnancies in 2013, the study found, 39 percent ended in abortion.

The study, done by the Guttmacher Institute, Tanzania's national medical research institute and the country's leading medical school, and published in PLOS One, was based on surveys of hospitals and clinics and interviews with Tanzanian doctors.

Although Tanzania ratified the African Union's 2005 Maputo Protocol on women's rights -- which endorsed abortion rights -- and also recognizes colonial-era British case law permitting abortion in some circumstances, national law mandates 14-year sentences for anyone ""unlawfully"" performing an abortion and seven years for women who try to make themselves miscarry -- but without defining ""unlawfully,"" said Sarah C. Keogh, a Guttmacher Institute researcher and the study's lead author.","According to a recent study, deaths result from several factors and women in some regions die much more often than others.",a6c5035f-cac7-5c46-b38b-782bdfb4c808,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/26/science/26GLOBAL/26GLOBAL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=91fbe101d3d3d26e26664b966870b70b66e241b3aba6437505b9a242b97cf6d2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A woman was hospitalized in Berega, Tanzania, after what may have been a botched abortion.",a6c5035f-cac7-5c46-b38b-782bdfb4c808,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1a6c5035f-cac7-5c46-b38b-782bdfb4c808.jpg,1,20

Real Estate,"Moving In, Slowly, to 'Billionaires' Row'",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/realestate/manhattan-luxury-high-rise-gets-its-first-residents.html,"As soon as Linda Phillips and her husband heard about One57, a luxury 90-story skyscraper that is nearing completion on West 57th Street, they raced from the pied-a-terre they rented at the Time Warner Center across Columbus Circle to take a look. The couple, empty-nesters who also own a home in Saddle River, N.J., eventually plunked down $30.4 million for a three-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath apartment, with floor-to-ceiling windows facing onto Central Park. Their lease at the Time Warner Center ends in September, and they may sell their New Jersey home to live full time in the building. ""With beautiful views and just a block from Bergdorf's, I think it doesn't get any better,"" said Mrs. Phillips, an interior designer. Much attention has been lavished on so-called Billionaires' Row, the stretch of West 57th Street where a spate of spindly towers filled with luxury condominiums is under construction and listing for record-breaking prices. The granddaddy of these new towers is One57 -- the first to break ground and now the first to see residents actually living there.

Since closings began late last year, 27 owners have been handed the keys to their multimillion-dollar homes. Walk by the building after dark, and it is possible to see the flicker of television screens and lights through a handful of windows. The details in publicly available documents suggest the buyers so far are a diverse bunch. There are the Russian oligarchs represented by large law firms in Midtown and the Chinese buyers whose identities are shielded by limited liability companies based in Shanghai. But there are also plenty of buyers like Leland A. Swanson, an owner of a successful vitamin business in Fargo, N.D., and Terry B. Johnson, the scion of a wealthy family that owns car dealerships in Duluth, Minn. ""One day I have to know all about feng shui, and the next I have to be able to talk to a pig farmer from Iowa,"" said Jeannie Woodbrey, a senior sales executive at the Extell Development Company, the developer of One57. ""I'm like a chameleon.""

But while there are buyers who do not often warrant mention in Page Six, there are also clear signs that One57 is home to a rarefied crowd. The building's head of operations, David M. Spector, cuts a strapping figure in his tailored suit, looking more like a fashion model than a building manager. And the doormen are outfitted with earpieces and tiny microphones attached to their sleeves, like secret service agents. Then there are the amenities. At the base of the building is the new Park Hyatt New York, which will open to guests on Aug. 12 and is already fully booked through Aug. 19. The condo owners living above the hotel will be able to order room service or ask the concierge for backstage passes to Lincoln Center -- for a price, of course. There are also a spa and the hotel pool, where residents swimming laps can listen via underwater speakers to the sound of a playlist curated by Carnegie Hall's programming team.

While there are now residents living at One57, they are still just ""a trickle,"" said Mr. Spector, who is a senior vice president at Extell Management Services. Many owners are summering outside the city and are using these slow months to complete their designs and further customize their homes, he said. ""I expect more people to move in and for things to pick up after Labor Day."" Mrs. Phillips and her husband, an ophthalmologist, for example, are installing additional bedroom closets, adding some mirrored accent walls and new hardware for the doors, as well as raising the baseboard heights -- ""just some aesthetic changes that I feel are important,"" said Mrs. Phillips, who will move in once the work is complete in the next several months. Nikki Field, a broker at Sotheby's International Realty who has represented several buyers at One57, said, ""The building finishes are lovely, so my clients are not doing a great deal of construction work, only small things. They also need to fully furnish the homes -- it isn't like they will move furniture from other locations."" Ms. Field said that just two of her clients will live at the building full time; the rest plan to use their apartments only part time. She noted that Extell Development may create some competition for itself when it opens a second new luxury tower just a block west. ""I do have a few, particularly those who purchased in the $50 million range, that are such fans of the developer they are considering his next building,"" said Ms. Field, referring to 225 West 57th Street, a condominium with at least 100 stories that will feature New York City's first full-line Nordstrom department store. That building is not set to open until 2018, ""so they are going to love this building and enjoy it,"" she said, ""but when there is a newer, shinier, prettier gal, they may decide to cash out and go for the next one.""

""I am flipping it as soon as I close,"" said one buyer who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""I bought it in an L.L.C. with partners, and honestly, if I had known that there would be this much attention on the building, and that my name would get out, I wouldn't have done it."" Ms. Field cautions her buyers not to re-list their apartments until the building is fully completed. ""I am advising my clients that the return will be stronger if they wait until the hotel is up and running and the building is finished,"" she said, ""so they can take full advantage of the value and the lifestyle."" The building still has about 25 percent of its units to sell, and the marketing to foreign buyers continues apace. On a recent weekday, for example, Stephen Kotler, the chief operating officer at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, was meeting Pieter van Naeltwijck, a broker based in Monte Carlo, and Natalia Kashirina, who represents Russian buyers from her base in London, in the lobby of One57 for a tour. ""These apartments represent an excellent investment, a super hedge,"" said George T. Constantin, the president and chief executive of Heritage Realty Services, which is based in New York. Mr. Constantin represents a Greek family who paid $30 million for a unit on the 59th floor. ""Usually that $30 million would go into U.S. Treasuries, but these types of investments offer more yield and better appreciation, so it serves a purpose,"" he said. As for other residents in the neighborhood, some are hoping this high-end construction could help their own real estate values. ""The history of New York real estate has been one of 'rising tide lifts all boats,' "" said Matthew Mazer, the president of the board of managers at the Briarcliffe, an apartment building at 171 West 57th Street, which is next to One57. ""I welcome our new neighbors, and maybe I will see them at Starbucks."" But several rent-regulated tenants also live in Mr. Mazer's building, and the influx of so many billionaires next door could potentially make the area less affordable for them. And while Mr. Mazer hopes to rub elbows with his new neighbors at the local coffee shop, it just may be their drivers who are standing in line for that cup of joe.","At One57, more than two dozen owners have gotten the keys to their units.

Music,Review: Roomful of Teeth Stretches for a Piano Premiere,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/arts/music/roomful-of-teeth-review-zankel-hall.html,"A musical week that began on Monday with displays of extended instrumental techniques, in the New York Philharmonic's Contact! concert at National Sawdust in Brooklyn, wound down on Thursday with a show of extended vocal techniques, by the ensemble Roomful of Teeth at Zankel Hall.

Roomful, an a cappella octet founded in 2009, is a veritable repository of such practices, using amplification and close miking to artistic effect. Its guiding philosophy was summed up by its artistic director, Brad Wells, in a preconcert discussion at Zankel: ""Voices can do so much more.""

More of what? The sky may be a limit, maybe not.

Roomful's great showpiece is the Partita for 8 Voices, a four-movement work by one of its members, the alto Caroline Shaw, which won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for music. The Pulitzer citation aptly described some of the techniques involved: ""speech, whispers, sighs, murmurs, wordless melodies and novel vocal effects."" It could have added grunts, rasps, throat singing and even a sort of winding twang suggesting a jaw harp.","The ensemble performed its showpiece, Partita for 8 Voices, in a program that also included the pianist-composer's Tigran Hamasyan's ""Ser Aravote.""",032f1928-c993-5728-b592-69bdee306185,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/13/arts/music/13roomful/13roomful-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=10760cfb0a6a4beeff08edd54f5c656e49c48fab9e9929a5034e5d50d97e316e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Roomful of Teeth at Zankel Hall.

Media,"Brian Williams, Retreading Memories From a Perch Too Public",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/09/business/media/brian-williams-and-memories-retread-from-a-perch-too-public.html,"For some time now, there have been two versions of Brian Williams. One is an Emmy-winning, sober, talented anchor on the ""NBC Nightly News"" and the other is a funny, urbane celebrity who hosts ""Saturday Night Live,"" slow-jams the news with Jimmy Fallon and crushes it in every speech and public appearance he makes. Each of those personas benefited the other, and his fame and appeal grew accordingly, past the anchor chair he occupied every weeknight and into a realm of celebrity that reaches all demographics and platforms. Even young people who wouldn't be caught dead watching the evening news know who Mr. Williams is. Which is good until it isn't. It was Mr. Williams himself who brought those two worlds together at the end of his newscast over a week ago when he broadcast a segment in which he was shown at a Rangers game in a tribute to a retiring command sergeant major, who, Mr. Williams suggested, had evacuated him from a dangerous situation in Iraq. ""The story actually started with a terrible moment a dozen years back during the invasion of Iraq when the helicopter we were traveling in was forced down after being hit by an R.P.G.,"" Mr. Williams said, introducing the segment, referring to a rocket-propelled grenade. ""Our traveling NBC News team was rescued, surrounded and kept alive by an armor mechanized platoon from the U.S. Army 3rd Infantry.""

But Stars and Stripes, the military publication, was tipped off that a thread popped up on NBC's Facebook page about the segment from soldiers who were there that day in 2003, saying Mr. Williams was describing something that happened to another helicopter, not his, and that he arrived later. Confronted with this, Mr. Williams acknowledged his mistake on his newscast last Wednesday, and offered up a muddled apology, saying he had conflated events in his memory. And then in a statement over the weekend, he said, ""In the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news, it has become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions."" He added: ""As managing editor of 'NBC Nightly News,' I have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days."" The perceptions of the weak, confused apology, and suspending himself for as long as he chooses, are not good for Mr. Williams or his employer. A full-throated, unmodulated apology is the only thing that will satisfy a public who placed their trust in him. And his voluntary step back, however well intended, suggests he is answerable only to himself. Indeed, the investigation at NBC will be led internally, by the head of investigations, who depends on Mr. Williams to make room for his work on the newscast. Deborah Turness, the embattled head of the news division, needed to demonstrate that someone was in charge of Mr. Williams and his fate. The American public won't abide someone putting himself into the naughty corner and setting the conditions for staying there. Beyond those strategic failures, if you are going to tell a war story that sprints past the truth, it best not be about war. Those of us who worked the Hurricane Katrina coverage rolled our eyes at some of the stories Mr. Williams told of the mayhem there, but it was a dark, confusing place and a lot of bad stuff happened, so who were we to judge? But armed service and its perils are seen as sacred and must not be trifled with. The soldiers who ended up in harm's way and survived that day are calling him out because their moral code requires it.

""Everyone tells lies,"" he wrote. ""Every single one of us. The issue isn't whether or not you lie. It is how you deal with it once you are caught. I thank you for stepping down for a few nights, Mr. Williams. Now can you admit that you didn't 'misremember' and perform a real apology? I might even buy you a beer."" Mr. Summerlin is right. I wrote a book some years back about the nature of memory and the stories we tell ourselves and others. Stories tend to grow over time and, if they are told often enough, they harden into a kind of new truth for the teller. Mr. Williams has been on almost every talk show you can think of and that requires not only a different skill set -- he is a gifted and funny performer -- but stories in abundance.
* Elizabeth Holmes Hones Her Defense in Day 2 of Testimony
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. It's useful to note that Mr. Williams initially reported the story fundamentally as it had happened -- although the soldiers on hand say he exaggerated the danger to himself even then -- and over time, as he retold it, he moved into the middle of it, so that the story became something that happened to him. All those 1 percent enhancements along the way add up and can leave the teller a long way from the truth. The evolution of his account was evident in a 2013 appearance on the ""Late Show With David Letterman."" ""We were in some helicopters. What we didn't know is we were north of the invasion,"" he said. ""Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire, including the one I was in, R.P.G. and AK-47.""

I haven't reported from a war zone, but I know the fog of war requires an excess of caution. You can't toe-touch and tell tall tales later. His NBC colleague David Bloom died of a pulmonary embolism while covering the war in 2003. In 2006 in Iraq, Bob Woodruff of ABC suffered a traumatic brain injury. Many, many journalists have been maimed or died in pursuit of the truth, and those who survive don't generally speak about it much. As the evening news anchor, Mr. Williams possesses a rare combination of fame and trust, with each feeding off the other. But fame is slippery, morphing into infamy very quickly, as Mr. Williams discovered in four days of sustained pounding. Everyone loves a story about seeing the mighty fall, even if they are as fundamentally likeable as Mr. Williams. (NBC confirmed that Mr. Williams would not be making a scheduled appearance on Mr. Letterman's show this week.) As it turns out, his non-apology was not a safe haven, but a trap door, and his self-banishment was not a consequence, but a mistake. I don't know if Mr. Williams will lose his job. I don't think he should -- his transgressions were not a fundamental part of his primary responsibilities. But if the executives who run NBC come to believe that he can't credibly cover combat or hurricanes, or call a politician on a lie, they will dismiss him even though there is no plan in place for succession. I watched him read the news on Friday night. Even playing hurt, he is very good at it. And I thought about how weird it would be to see him doing the job in a hair shirt for months or years to come. It's an image that clanks. We want our anchors to be both good at reading the news and also pretending to be in the middle of it. That's why, when the forces of man or Mother Nature whip up chaos, both broadcast and cable news outlets are compelled to ship the whole heaving apparatus to far-flung parts of the globe, with an anchor as the flag bearer. We want our anchors to be everywhere, to be impossibly famous, globe-trotting, hilarious, down-to-earth, and above all, trustworthy. It's a job description that no one can match.","For some time now, there have been two versions of Brian Williams.

Last month, YoungBoy, whose real name is Kentrell Gaulden, was sentenced to 90 days in jail and ordered not to give any public performances for 14 months after a Louisiana judge found that he had violated his parole; in 2017 he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault with a firearm.

Travel,A Charleston Restaurant Twisting Lowcountry Classics,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/travel/charleston-restaurant-the-watch-rooftop-kitchen-spirits.html,"Hearing the words ""hotel"" and ""restaurant"" in succession can often be a red flag for a discriminating diner. It's even worse if ""view"" is tagged on -- the eye-pleasing sights from high above somehow always outshine what emerges from the kitchen. So while I rode the elevator up to the seventh floor to dine at the Watch Rooftop Kitchen & Spirits -- the highest restaurant in Charleston, in the recently refurbished hotel the Restoration -- my gut felt skeptical.

As soon as I entered, my concerns, at least about the location, right in the center of town, were allayed. The Watch, which opened in January, offers a simple interior -- plain, light-hued walls and an ample number of windows; nothing could compete with the views over this 350-year-old city. I sipped an Old Exchange, a riff on the Old Fashioned using locally made Virgil Kaine rye whiskey, bitters and an orange slice; perused the menu; and stared out at the church steeples looming in the distance.

Chad Anderson, the chef, has concocted a menu that blends Lowcountry fare and international dishes aimed at tourists who need a break from (or may balk at) the hearty local cuisine. You could order the falafel, ratatouille or Maine lobster roll. Better, turn to the Lowcountry staples, which even locals may find intriguing as many are refreshed with a creative twist.

""It's a challenge putting my own spin on classic Lowcountry dishes because they're often just perfect the way they are,"" Mr. Anderson said. ""However, I feel that there is always room for an inspired chef to make their mark with a particular dish by bending the rules a little.""",The Watch features a menu that blends Lowcountry fare and international dishes.,aca28a68-a906-5375-abb6-75b719731b66,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/10/travel/10BITES/10BITES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=58bb29b5616cabea76bb2eb6d1fa9308d5bd54078167a8d66ad2a3c57405d044&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Shrimp and grits gets a kick from Cajun spice in the bacon-tomato gravy.,aca28a68-a906-5375-abb6-75b719731b66,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1aca28a68-a906-5375-abb6-75b719731b66.jpg,4,17
Health,UnitedHealth Buys Large Doctors Group as Lines Blur in Health Care,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/health/unitedhealth-doctors-insurance.html,"In another example of the blurring boundaries in the health care industry, UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation's largest insurers, said on Wednesday that it is buying a large physician group to add to its existing roster of 30,000 doctors. UnitedHealth's Optum unit will acquire the physician group from DaVita, a large for-profit chain of dialysis centers, for about $4.9 billion in cash, subject to regulatory approval. DaVita operates nearly 300 clinics across a half-dozen states, including California and Florida. With the purchase, UnitedHealth is increasingly moving into the direct delivery of medical care. ""Combining DaVita Medical Group and Optum advances our shared goal of supporting physicians in delivering exceptional patient care in innovative and efficient ways,"" Larry C. Renfro, Optum's chief executive, said in a statement. Analysts praised the move as keeping with UnitedHealth's broader goal of building a large ambulatory care business.

""The asset is strongly synergistic"" with the company's overall ""mission and strategy,"" Ana Gupte, an analyst for Leerink, told investors after the deal was announced. The proposed acquisition comes after the announcement that another big insurer, Aetna, planned to merge with CVS Health. That transaction, if approved, could transform CVS's 10,000 drugstores into community-based health care ""hubs,"" where people could get blood tests or help managing a chronic disease like diabetes. Executives at Aetna and CVS said that this new model would result in better care and lower costs for patients. At a time of growing uncertainty in the health care marketplace, doctors, drugstores, hospitals and insurers are looking outside their traditional businesses to join forces. The tax overhaul proposed congressional Republicans could cut payments to federal programs like Medicare sharply and upend the Affordable Care Act, and employers and consumers are increasingly worried about the high cost of medical care. The potential threat of new competitors like Amazon entering the pharmacy business and technology companies delivering medical care through cellphones has led former adversaries to become partners, driving insurers to team up with hospitals and doctors' groups. They are seeking to deliver care in novel ways, outside the expensive setting of a hospital. While the combination with CVS allows Aetna to experiment with providing medical care in a retail setting, insurers are also looking to partner directly with doctors and health systems. To change how people receive medical care, particularly when managing chronic, and costly, diseases like diabetes and asthma, the parties ""are going to have to reorganize,"" said Craig Garthwaite, a health economist at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

""There's no chance that the existing companies, be they hospital or insurers, have the right configuration of assets to be successful"" at turning health care into a business where the parties are able to produce better outcomes at a lower cost, he said. What is striking about the recent combinations, Professor Garthwaite said, is that insurers are the ones seeking to integrate the delivery of care into their operations, as opposed to a large health system like Kaiser Permanente, the health maintenance organization based in California, directing members to its hospitals and doctors. ""For a long time, we thought there was a world in which Kaiser was the future,"" he said. But Kaiser Permanente has proved to be mostly an exception to the rule. Several large systems began offering health plans under the Affordable Care Act, only to end up losing money and getting out of the business. Aetna and UnitedHealth appear to be trying to develop their own in-house network of doctors to try to change how care is delivered. UnitedHealth, which already operates a large pharmacy-benefit manager and a variety of health care services through its Optum unit, is among the most diversified and most successful insurers. The acquisition of DaVita Medical Group, which includes such high profile organizations as HealthCare Partners and the Everett Clinic, is the latest move by UnitedHealth to expand into the realm of delivering medical care as a way of reducing costs. The company already operates medical practices in Southern California and elsewhere, and it owns nearly 250 MedExpress urgent-care clinics. The company says the clinics offer much of the same care available at a hospital emergency room but at a significantly lower cost. Last January, UnitedHealth also acquired a chain of surgery centers, a move the company said could lower the expense of having an outpatient surgery by more than 50 percent. The company expects to perform roughly 1 million surgeries and other procedures this year. Insurers are also increasingly experimenting with different methods of paying for care and attempting to provide better oversight of potentially expensive chronic conditions like diabetes or heart failure. To date, Aetna and Cigna have favored joint ventures with large health groups.

While these new partnerships promise to change how people get care, by marshaling better information about patients and steering them to less expensive and more convenient places, whether an urgent-care clinic or drugstore, delivering on that promise may prove challenging. DaVita, which bought HealthCare Partners five years ago as a way to become a major player in the care of people with chronic conditions, found itself struggling to make money on its medical group. In describing the group's most recent quarterly financial results, DaVita's chief executive, Kent J. Thiry, said they were ""extremely disappointing."" The sale, which is expected to close next year, return DaVita to its core kidney dialysis business, although Mr. Thiry said in a statement that the company expected ""to pursue other investments in health care services outside of kidney care."" DaVita has been under scrutiny for its relationship with a charity, the American Kidney Fund, that helps pay the cost of private insurance for patients receiving dialysis treatment. Consumers could also see their choice of doctor or pharmacy sharply limited under these arrangements as insurers attempt to steer patients into the groups over which they have the most control. Both Aetna and UnitedHealth insist their goal is to develop a new model of care that will be available to people outside their respective health plans, and Optum says it now works with more than 80 health plans. Even if insurers succeed in lowering medical costs as a result of the new ventures, economists and other experts warn that shareholders, not consumers, could benefit unless the lower costs yield lower prices for coverage. There must be sufficient competition among insurers for consumers to benefit, Professor Garthwaite said. ""You need three, four or five insurance companies trying to pull that strategy off,"" he said. ""That's really hard to do.""",The purchase of DaVita Medical Group moves UnitedHealth more into the role of doctor as it buys nearly 300 clinics across six states.,6131c870-ddf4-5d1e-b4fb-c84c3003b4c7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/07/business/07insure/07insure-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=c0eb4d392a5b166132fe45ee4b0f28dff6d042c2b247b690d25117f1812ec2d1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Part of the UnitedHealth Group campus in Minnetonka, Minn.

Education,"At High School in Queens, R.O.T.C.'s Enduring Influence",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/education/20oneducation.html,"An overcrowded, immigrant-dominated public high school in Queens is the unexpected home of one of the largest Junior ROTC programs in the nation, and it produces impressive results.

In 1994, when retired First Sgt. Richard Gogarty arrived at Francis Lewis High School in Queens to start an Army Junior R.O.T.C. program, only two staff members, one of them a custodian, would talk to him. The sergeant sat by himself in the teachers' cafeteria, hoping someone would say something, even if it was just ""please pass the salt."" The union representative, Arthur Goldstein, did not want him there. ""I said, 'Oh my God, he's going to have kids marching in circles doing stupid stuff,' "" recalled Mr. Goldstein, who teaches English to immigrant students and describes himself as ""politically to the left."" But Sergeant Gogarty, using his military training, disarmed Mr. Goldstein, volunteering to come in an hour early each day to tutor a Hispanic girl who was failing. ""She was completely lost,"" Mr. Goldstein said. ""But something clicked. She started passing tests -- it was Richard reading with her in the morning."" Every year since, the Reserve Officers Training Corps program has grown. With 741 students, it is the largest of the 1,725 high school chapters in the country. Francis Lewis has more graduates at West Point -- 15 -- than any other school this year except for one near the academy that serves military families. In 17 years, no senior in the program has dropped out of school.

The high point of Christina Liu's life so far was being part of the squad that won the national unarmed drill competition last year in Florida. ""I probably had pure happiness for 10 minutes,"" she said. ""I was able to experience a first place in my lifetime. What person can say that?"" Until her first competition, Christina had never left Queens; with R.O.T.C., she has been to seven states. As much as they like R.O.T.C., most do not want to enlist in the service. ""The military -- I don't think that's for me,"" said Glen Higgins, a junior who is a member of the drum corps. ""I don't want to end up going to Iraq and risk my life or something."" Christina, one of the highest-ranked cadets, wants to be a pharmacist. ""My mom always wanted me to be one,"" she said. ""You get to stand behind a counter all day and there's not much stress."" Sergeant Gogarty is the antithesis of the high-pressured military recruiter out to fill a quota. ""If they say they're going to enlist when they graduate, I tell them to go to college first,"" he said. Only one or two students a year go straight into the Army.

The program -- which has a staff of six retired service members teaching 23 classes a day focusing on things like community service and public speaking -- costs $1 million a year, $180,000 of which is paid by the city. Francis Lewis is so crowded -- 4,000 students in a building meant for about 2,500 -- that J.R.O.T.C. usually cannot get the gym, so cadets often have lengthy training sessions on Saturdays. Its drill teams use the cafeteria, but cannot practice the rifle toss, which could punch holes in the ceiling. Membership reflects the school's demographics: half are Asian, 20 percent Hispanic, 15 percent black and 15 percent white; 99 percent go on to college. On Wednesdays, all 741 wear their uniforms to school.

""It gives you something to look forward to,"" said David Artega, a senior. The military chain of command teaches them discipline, leadership and responsibility. ""You learn you have to be on top of yourself,"" said Ashley Schwartz, a senior. Sergeant Gogarty knows his students are prepared when the Rockettes start to look sloppy to them. ""Not enough economy of movement,"" he said. The senior cadets watch the freshmen make the same mistakes each year. ""They think they're fine the way they are,"" David said. Sergeant Gogarty teaches them: not by a long shot. In the beginning, they are afraid of Sergeant Gogarty. ""They think I know all their names and what they're up to,"" he said. ""I don't, but I let them think I do."" Once he remembers, he does not forget. Dana Walcott, the daughter of the schools chancellor, Dennis M. Walcott, went through the program in the 1990s. ""Dana was a platoon leader,"" Sergeant Gogarty said. ""She was enthusiastic and focused. She loved to cook and bake.""

""I noticed,"" Sergeant Gogarty said. ""I started watching very hard in January."" The J.R.O.T.C. room, 219, is one of the few places where a freshman like Brian Eco can talk to a real-life senior like Ashley. ""She motivates young students like me,"" Brian said. ""She does not make mistakes, her uniform is tight."" Several mentioned that the program helped them overcome shyness. ""Before, I couldn't give a speech to 30 people,"" Tom Saini, a senior, said. ""Now I can do 500, easy."" Frank Chang said he was ""one of those Asians kids sitting in the corner who doesn't talk to anybody."" Not only were all the J.R.O.T.C. activities good for getting him out of the corner, but they helped him build his resume for college. ""It got me up to two pages."" Sergeant Gogarty no longer has to recruit. Jennifer Lewis was a member of the first cadet class, in 1994, and this year her daughter, Kiera, joined. Most likely next will be her little brother, Jaden, a fourth grader. ""He loves staring at all my ribbons,"" Kiera, a sophomore, said. ""He keeps asking, 'What's this one for? What's that one for?' "" Memorial Day weekend the cadets marched all over Queens, in five parades. ""My last parade,"" said Frank, who will attend Queens College in the fall, ""a lot of things went through my head. I wanted to enjoy it, seize the moment.""","The program at Francis Lewis High School, which has grown every year since its inception, is the largest of the 1,725 high school chapters in the country.",9c28dd92-ab76-545c-996a-191565bd2e7b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/06/20/nyregion/onedu1/onedu1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=350&w=600&s=3603ccfb37b1ba3cd63fee7b710a65a5ac40795fcbd051102d52864dab85aeac&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Members of the Army Junior R.O.T.C. program at Francis Lewis High School in an annual pass-in-review ceremony last month.,9c28dd92-ab76-545c-996a-191565bd2e7b,Demo_data/D1_imgs/19c28dd92-ab76-545c-996a-191565bd2e7b.jpg,22,22
Fashion & Style,How the Met Got the Vatican's Vestments,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/fashion/heavenly-bodies-met-gala-vatican.html,"VATICAN CITY -- Archbishop Georg Ganswein said yes to the dress. The dashing former right-hand man to Benedict XVI, the fashion-plate pope, he is now prefect of the papal household under the more austere Pope Francis. In May 2017, Archbishop Ganswein sat in his stately Apostolic Palace office as Andrew Bolton, curator in charge of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, showed him a look book of couture masterpieces that Mr. Bolton felt matched with certain Vatican treasures. Archbishop Ganswein, in a soutane with purple sash, indifferently flipped pages of designer frocks until he lingered on a luxurious Madame Gres dress inspired by a Franciscan habit. ""They all love that,"" Mr. Bolton said of the dress. The archbishop gradually became enthusiastic as he and Mr. Bolton discussed the role of beauty in the church and Mr. Bolton explained his vision for the project that would explore the way the Catholic church had served as an inspiration to designers through the centuries. Then things really started rolling.

Mr. Bolton received authorization from senior Vatican officials to borrow the vestments. He was also granted full access to the Sistine Chapel Sacristy and became so close with its custodian priests in his 10 trips to Rome that they entrusted him with the hidden chamber's keys and opened secret doors, behind which elderly nuns ironed the pope's white vestments. The show that would ultimately become ""Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,"" the biggest exhibit the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum has ever held, opening May 10, was on the verge of becoming a reality.

While the Vatican may be enthusiastic about ""Heavenly Bodies"" now, it took years for it to warm to an exhibit that Mr. Bolton first envisioned as including many religious traditions. Dealing with one church proved to be enough. In June 2016, a colleague of Mr. Bolton's in the Met's European paintings department put him in touch with Arnold Nesselrath, a Vatican museum curator. Mr. Nesselrath arranged for Mr. Bolton to visit the Sistine Chapel Sacristy, a chamber of rooms within rooms containing a hive of numbered wooden doors and drawers bearing embossed strips and containing shawls and stoles, papal tiaras, papal rings and pectoral crosses. Mr. Bolton tried to explain the concept of the exhibition to the keeper of the sacristy, a quiet Slovakian priest named Pavel Benedik. ""He wasn't quite sure what the request was,"" Mr. Bolton said of Father Benedik. ""He was confused."" To expedite the process, Mr. Nesselrath suggested that on his next visit, Mr. Bolton meet with Barbara Jatta, now the director of the Vatican museum. For that trip, Mr. Bolton brought along Ms. Wintour. Ms. Jatta arranged several tours for them, including another trip to the Sacristy, where this time Father Benedik's assistant, Antonio, showed them around. Ms. Jatta asked how many items the Met intended to borrow, and Mr. Bolton responded: about eight. Ms. Wintour said he needed to ask for at least twice that, prompting a skeptical laugh from Ms. Jatta. (The Met eventually got more than 40.) Ms. Jatta then informed the curator that the lending of the pieces was, anyway, out of her hands. ""These vestments don't belong to the Vatican Museum,"" she said, according to Mr. Bolton. ""They belong to the Sistine Chapel Sacristy.""

On one of those visits, a priest gave Mr. Bolton and Hamish Bowles, a writer for Vogue, a behind-the-scenes tour of the Vatican. The priest opened the door to a room where eight nuns, including a shrunken nonagenarian on a step, ironed the pope's white vestments. Mr. Bolton learned that the popes all had their own styles and that ""there is personality behind"" all of the separate tiaras and vestments. He himself often gravitated toward the ornate vestments of Pope Pius IX. ""He was quite the dandy,"" Mr. Bolton said. And Father Benedik warmed to him. Nevertheless, the priest lacked the power to authorize a loan and suggested that Mr. Bolton talk to Archbishop Ganswein. ""He's like a movie star, it's like meeting George Clooney,"" Mr. Bolton said of the archbishop, often called ""Gorgeous George."" Archbishop Ganswein, apparently on board, told Mr. Bolton to send an official request to Msgr. Guido Marini, the papal master of liturgical celebrations and the keeper of the sacristy.

When permission was granted, Mr. Bolton returned for many more trips and, with Father Benedik, refined the list of objects to borrow, including a papal tiara with 19,000 precious stones, including 18,000 diamonds. (It will fly to New York with its own bodyguard.) During one 10-day stretch of 12-hour days inside the Sacristy with Katarina Jebb, who scanned the objects for the catalog, the custodians entrusted Mr. Bolton with the keys to the Sacristy. After the Loans, More Risks With the loans secured, Mr. Bolton asked David Tracy, a highly regarded Catholic writer -- Mr. Bolton called him ""the J.D. Salinger of the theological world"" -- to contribute an essay to the catalog to lend it intellectual heft. It took a year before he agreed. Then Mr. Bolton tackled the New York side of the equation, trying to ensure he wasn't accidentally touching any third rails.

He asked Emily Rafferty, a former president of the Met with connections to New York's Catholic community, for a hand. She suggested Mr. Bolton work with James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor at large for America Magazine, who was appointed last year by Pope Francis as a consultor to the Vatican's Secretariat for Communications. Father Martin said that one day, after embarrassingly spilling hummus on his pants earlier, he went to a Met conference room to review the storyboards the curators had pinned to the walls with thumbtacks. He was impressed by what he described as the ""real attention to Catholic sensibilities"" behind the pairings. Asked by Mr. Bolton and colleagues if he thought the presentation would prompt any blowback, Father Martin said there may be some complaints about ""celebrity culture being grafted onto the church,"" but that he thought it would be minor. ""They will see something beautiful, and that's part of the Catholic imagination,"" he said. It was also Father Martin who, reviewing the gift catalog, noticed that one necklace was described as adorned with a ""winged man,"" and told the Met: ""It's O.K. to say 'angel.'"" He also suggested asking Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, the de facto minister of culture for the Vatican and an erudite former prefect of the Biblioteca-Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan, to contribute to the exhibit catalog. Cardinal Ravasi had gotten to know many of the great designers during his time in the fashion capital, including Miuccia Prada, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, and Giorgio Armani.",The inside story of how the Met's Costume Institute convinced the papal powers to be part of a fashion exhibit,2a540986-88d7-57cc-98a7-2e6cac33f788,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/04/fashion/04-MET-GALA-VATICAN-1/04-MET-GALA-VATICAN-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=7931d3343f9d7b8f4e1fbb0fa424dc2397635bcb58890f660a92a70ce272a373&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Christine Hearst Schwarzman, Donatella Versace and Stephen A.

Art & Design,Veteran of Cheim & Read Gallery Moves to Pace,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/arts/design/adam-sheffer-cheim-read-pace-gallery.html,"Fast on the heels of Cheim & Read gallery's announcement that it plans to close in Chelsea and transition to private practice uptown, Adam Sheffer, its longtime partner and sales director, is joining Pace Gallery as vice president beginning in August.

""He's a guy who would walk through fire for his artists -- definitely walk in front of a truck for them,"" said Marc Glimcher, Pace's president and chief executive. ""There are brilliant people who are kind of disconnected and then there are ambitious people who have no sense of history -- finding someone with both is like needle in a haystack.""

Mr. Sheffer's move is likely to raise eyebrows, given his prominence in the art market -- he recently served as president of the Art Dealers Association of America, the trade organization -- and the implication that his planned departure for Pace was closely tied to Cheim & Read's demise.

But Mr. Sheffer in a telephone interview said the two developments were unrelated. ""The culture Pace Gallery represents is consistent with what I wanted in the next chapter of my life,"" he said, adding of Mr. Glimcher, ""He's the only dealer who's been able to understand and interpret what's happening in Silicon Valley, for instance. It's not just about global domination, it's about being a visionary.""","Just as Cheim & Read closes in Chelsea, Adam Sheffer, one of its longtime partners, becomes a vice president at Pace.",5d3d5863-508a-5d84-98c3-5792b097513e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/10/arts/design/10pace1/10pace1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=8a2ad9a788d50b26109f08d7d98a27188620e6157a8ee3d508ddd6d5d4ab2678&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Adam Sheffer said his move to the Pace Gallery in August is unrelated to Cheim &amp; Read's closing in Chelsea.,5d3d5863-508a-5d84-98c3-5792b097513e,Demo_data/D1_imgs/15d3d5863-508a-5d84-98c3-5792b097513e.jpg,14,14
Theater,"What Small Theater Does for New York? A Lot, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/theater/small-theaters-economic-impact-study.html,"It argues that small venue theaters -- the term it uses for the range of New York City theaters beyond Broadway -- have an outsize cultural influence, often nurturing risky work, and reaching a wider audience with more affordable tickets.

And it suggests a link between the nonprofit theater world and the growing production of streaming content in the city, noting that some of the same artists work in both areas.

The study calculates that theaters aside from Broadway are responsible for $584 million in direct annual economic output, and estimates $1.3 billion in ""direct, indirect and induced benefits.""

""Traditionally people have viewed this as a niche sector, but we found it's a significant contributor to the creative sector in New York City, and also a significant economic driver,"" said Anne del Castillo, the commissioner of the city agency.

And the study cites the success of recent shows such as ""Hadestown"" (first presented at New York Theater Workshop) and ""The Band's Visit"" (at Atlantic Theater Company), each of which eventually reached Broadway and won the Tony Award for best new musical, as well as ""Hamilton"" (at the Public Theater) and ""Fairview"" (at Soho Rep), each of which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama.

Music,Gil Scott-Heron's Legacy Is a Work in Progress,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/arts/music/gil-scott-heron-makaya-mccraven.html,"When the drummer and producer Makaya McCraven got a call inviting him to rework Gil Scott-Heron's final record, he recognized the magnitude of the task. He knew a lot about the poet, novelist, musician and Black Arts Movement hero often called the ""godfather of rap."" But he had heard much less about the album, ""I'm New Here,"" which came out in 2010, a year before Scott-Heron's death at 62. When Mr. McCraven dug into the album, he was struck by a quandary. ""This sounds like it's already been remixed,"" he said he remembered thinking, listening to the spare, heavily electronic LP.

The string of brilliant recordings that Gil Scott-Heron made from the 1970s to the early '80s represent one of the most important runs of resistance music created by any artist in modern history -- the call-to-consciousness proto-rap anthem ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised""; the allegorical ballad ""Winter in America."" Perhaps only Bob Marley rivals him, and Marley's music was resistance of a different sort: less politically literate, dreamier. ""I'm New Here"" was recorded in the late-aughts, in a series of trans-Atlantic sessions between Scott-Heron and the record producer Richard Russell, an executive at the record label XL, who is based in Britain. It was Scott-Heron's first album in 40 years not to feature a full band; instead it centered on the spare, gunmetal beats that Mr. Russell draped around Scott-Heron's voice, fostering a sense of both claustrophobia and remove. Mr. McCraven let those electronic tracks go. ""I wanted to support his voice, and then try to do something of my own along with it,"" he said. So he went straight for Scott-Heron's vocal stems, then brought in other young jazz musicians to record some live tracks with him. Using his trademark production approach, Mr. McCraven spliced up the music they'd laid down -- mixing in some old recordings by his father, the drummer Stephen McCraven, and ending up with a bristling crosstown junction of hip-hop, Afrobeat, European folk music and jazz. The resulting album, ""We're New Again,"" which XL will release on Friday, doesn't recreate the loose Caribbean funk sound of Scott-Heron's classic bands. Mr. McCraven's instrumentals are a cosmopolitan tangle -- founded in samples and syncretism -- that belongs firmly to the fast-advancing 21st century.

But Mr. McCraven has done some restoration work. On the original ""I'm New Here,"" the flickering gloom of Mr. Russell's production often made Scott-Heron sound cloistered and defeated, even as his poetry pulsed with its typical humor, self-effacement and vision. On ""We're New Again,"" Mr. McCraven's arrangements exhume a feeling of potential, a promise of communion -- the things that were always at Scott-Heron's creative core. Scott-Heron is heard on both albums reading his poem ""On Coming From a Broken Home,"" which celebrates the women who raised him: ""I came from what they called 'a broken home,' but if they'd ever really called at our house, they would have known how wrong they were."" On ""We're New Again,"" Mr. McCraven has combined an old recording of his mother, Agnes Zsigmondi, playing the flute while his father plays the kalimba with new tracks, including the young harpist Brandee Younger. As Scott-Heron speaks of communion with his own ancestry, the instrumentals bubble together and generations interlace. When ""I'm New Here"" came out in 2010, Scott-Heron had not released a studio album in more than 15 years, and he was in the throes of a drug addiction that he would never fully outrun. In an interview with The New Yorker shortly after its release, Scott-Heron called the album ""Richard's CD,"" saying that Mr. Russell's enthusiasm had led to the collaboration: ""All the dreams you show up in are not your own."" ""We're New Again"" strips away the electronic tracks of ""I'm New Here."" Speaking from London this week, Mr. Russell said that Scott-Heron had first insisted that both of them should claim authorship of the album, but Mr. Russell had dismissed that idea.

So maybe it makes sense to think about ""I'm New Here"" and the smattering of follow-up materials that have trickled out over the past decade (mixtapes, outtakes collections, short documentaries) as Scott-Heron himself seems to have understood the album: not as his own last solo statement, but as a collaboration, initiated and largely carried through by Russell. As the 10th anniversary of Scott-Heron's death approaches, he deserves to be remembered for the impact he made upon his own time, and its resonance across eras. Everything he put out between 1974 and 1982 is effectively out of print, and unavailable on streaming services. His children, from different romantic relationships, have been at loggerheads since his death, creating a legal knot. Still, his work is out there on YouTube, in used-record stores, and on the lips of everyone who uses the phrases he coined, whether they know it or not: ""the revolution will not be televised,"" ""home is where the hatred is."" As well as rap's godfather, it would be wise to recall that Scott-Heron -- whose work was anchored in Southern blues and the black literary canon -- was the bard of the Black Power Movement. And as that movement's push for equal access to political power remains unfinished, the insights of his poetry still bear heavily on today. ""The work is there,"" said the scholar and critic Greg Tate, who had known Scott-Heron. ""Anybody whose work has that depth -- in terms of a contemporary reckoning, it's just a matter of time. It's inevitable.""",A reimagining of his final album by the drummer and producer Makaya McCraven is another step toward a contemporary reckoning with his powerful oeuvre.,d2ff97e1-82df-5fbe-98c2-acac1ecf3743,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/06/arts/05mccraven/05mccraven-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=4860a8d60a2495dd2f5971ded1ce2877cc948705a43394fad4ff16883dcd41ed&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Gil Scott-Heron in performance.,d2ff97e1-82df-5fbe-98c2-acac1ecf3743,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1d2ff97e1-82df-5fbe-98c2-acac1ecf3743.jpg,12,20
Style,Dressing the Part: Melania Trump at the White House Easter Egg Roll,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/style/melania-trump-white-house-easter-egg-roll.html,"Since the Easter Egg Roll was revived under Betty Ford, most of the first ladies who have hosted the event wore suits, or at least jackets, suggesting it was a professional commitment. Hillary Clinton displayed her penchant for rainbow-colored pantsuits when she was host, resplendent one year in buttercup yellow, another in grass green. When the Obamas were in the White House, they significantly relaxed the rules, the president often going without a tie or jacket, and Michelle Obama most often in pants with a J. Crew T-shirt or cardigan and Converse (one Tracy Reese floral dress excepted). The message was one of a new, more relaxed, modern and active era.

But just as the Ralph Lauren suit that Mrs. Trump wore during the inaugural parade called to mind Jackie Kennedy and Camelot, the pink dress called to mind another, more rarefied time. It was for neither work nor play, but rather a Great Gatsby garden party.

Indeed, in its unique, made-to-order-ness, it was itself a rarefied garment -- Mr. Pierre does not have his own commercial collection, so he will not be reproducing the dress, as he acknowledged -- and thus in line with Mr. Trump's image-making. This is not about outreach or accessibility. It's about aspirational role-play of a highly telegenic kind.

That's why in so many ways Mrs. Trump's clothes increasingly seem like costumes for a series titled ""In The White House"": a perfect camera-ready version of what one imagines a first lady might wear, from the almost military-inspired suits and coats she has been choosing for various official appearances -- the belted white trench coat from The Row she wore at the International Women of Courage Awards; the Dolce & Gabbana jacket she wore for her official portrait; the belted green dress she wore to accompany Queen Raina of Jordan to a Washington charter school -- to the more romantic, but minimal, organzas of Mr. Pierre.","The Hervé Pierre frock was another of Mrs. Trump's camera-ready choices, just what you imagine a first lady might wear.",b7c9d66d-14d4-5edf-ac17-8451db87b86d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/19/fashion/18otr-A/18otr-A-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=880e93c509eccda8ecd2586efa705ddacf3dc07e8cb2ead0afea8f1516c8a3a4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Melania Trump in a dress by Hervé Pierre, with President Trump and their son Barron, at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll.",b7c9d66d-14d4-5edf-ac17-8451db87b86d,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1b7c9d66d-14d4-5edf-ac17-8451db87b86d.jpg,15,19
Dance,"In Their Ardor and Sweep, Hints of an Emerging Gold Standard",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/12/arts/dance/city-ballet-presents-a-lyrical-program-in-saratoga.html,"SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. -- To watch New York City Ballet at its open-air summer home at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center on Thursday afternoon was to be made forcefully aware not just how well the company is currently dancing but with what exuberance. Next week, when Moscow's legendary Bolshoi Ballet opens at the David H. Koch Theater in Manhattan -- and two weeks later, when it arrives here -- it will be judged by two standards: memories and films of its own past achievements, and the highest standards of today's foremost American companies.

City Ballet's Sara Mearns in ""Walpurgisnacht Ballet""! Tiler Peck in ""Who Cares?""! These are among the supreme ballerina performances of our day -- how glorious to see them in a single afternoon -- and the kind of scale, ardor and sweep that they exemplify are qualities that used to be the Bolshoi's.

When the Bolshoi first hit the West in the 1950s, it brought its own bacchantes-and-satyrs version of ""Walpurgisnacht,"" choreographed by Leonid Lavrovsky to the same ballet music from Gounod's opera ""Faust"": Its extravagant fervor was just the kind of thing no Western company could equal. But in 1979, when Jerome Robbins made his Verdi ballet ""The Four Seasons"" for City Ballet, he specifically and effectively imitated those very bacchantes and satyrs.

And a year later Balanchine gave City Ballet his own pure-dance version of that Gounod music: His ""Walpurgisnacht Ballet,"" with no mythological creatures at all, catches the music's duplicitous nature, a seemingly courteous charm that then acquires levels of dark abandon. And though some of Balanchine's individual steps recalled the old Bolshoi divertissement, he connected them with a dazzlingly rococo bravura previously unknown anywhere. The ballerina role was one of the first of Ms. Mearns's career; today it's the one that best sums up her voluptuous glamour.","New York City Ballet danced works by Balanchine, Jerome Robbins and Justin Peck, its new resident choreographer, on Thursday afternoon at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center.",c3055073-2dc0-57a2-b192-75946ab8254c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/12/arts/NYCB/NYCB-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=410&w=600&s=e8c2280579829f4bc6d25fb38f0bc30c9a692fa19da4f6dd05609b345342e255&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"New York City Ballet Maria Kowroski and Robert Fairchild in Justin Peck's new work ""Everywhere We Go"" on Thursday afternoon at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center.",c3055073-2dc0-57a2-b192-75946ab8254c,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1c3055073-2dc0-57a2-b192-75946ab8254c.jpg,6,10
Opinion,President Trump Has Tools to Pressure China. Will He Use Them?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/china-hong-kong-uighur-trump.html,"The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values . It is separate from the newsroom.



Much of the focus on China in recent months has been over the coronavirus that originated there late last year. But that has hardly slowed Beijing's assault on fundamental freedoms and human rights, from the brutal repression of the Uighurs to choking off Hong Kong's limited autonomy. Congress has acted with admirable alacrity and unanimity to pass tough bills allowing for the imposition of sanctions against the Chinese officials and enterprises behind these outrages. It is now for President Trump, who has shown little enthusiasm so far for tangling with President Xi Jinping over human rights, to use the tools that Congress has placed at his disposal to show Beijing that its transgressions have consequences. The new national-security law for Hong Kong is the most current and most publicized example of Mr. Xi's repressive, nationalistic policies. The measure severely erodes Hong Kong's civil and political freedoms, undermining the ""one country, two systems"" model that China pledged when the British colony reverted to Beijing's rule in 1997. One of the first arrests under the new law was of a protester with a pro-independence flag, the display of which is now a criminal offense. As a result, a bipartisan push is now underway in Congress to grant refugee status to certain Hong Kong residents. But while Hong Kong has garnered the most attention in the West, it is hardly the sole, or even the worst, of the Chinese government's systemic violations of elemental human rights. These are among other recent developments: # A new report from the Jamestown Foundation has exposed chilling details of official measures to shrink the Uighur population, including sterilization and forced abortions. The report by Adrian Zenz, a leading authority on the mass detention of Uighurs in Chinese prison camps, found that while China has long sought to manage its vast population, the draconian controls in the Western region of Xinjiang were intended ""to suppress minority population growth"" while boosting the majority Han population through increased births and migration. Natural population growth in the region, the report found, had ""declined dramatically.""

# On Wednesday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials in New York announced that they had seized a large shipment of weaves and other beauty products that officials suspect were made out of human hair from people locked inside the Xinjiang camp system. ""The production of these goods constitutes a very serious human rights violation, and the detention order is intended to send a clear and direct message to all entities seeking to do business with the United States that illicit and inhumane practices will not be tolerated in U.S. supply chains,"" Brenda Smith, a customs official, told The Associated Press. An American government advisory issued Wednesday warned companies that they risk ""reputational, economic, and legal risks"" from doing business with companies that used Xinjiang forced labor. # More than 50 independent United Nations experts signed a statement last week charging that their repeated efforts to communicate their alarm to Chinese authorities about the suppression of democracy in Hong Kong, the collective repression of religious and ethnic minorities, excessive use of force by the police, detention of human rights defenders and other violations have been systematically rejected, and requests for investigations dismissed. The group called for a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council to evaluate their charges, and the establishment of an independent mechanism to monitor the human rights situation in China. # Researchers at Lookout, a San Francisco mobile security firm, reported Wednesday that China's massive surveillance efforts in Xinjiang, which have expanded to include measures like collecting blood samples, voice prints, facial scans and other personal data, began as early as 2013 with a hacking campaign that planted malware into the cellphones of Uighurs and Tibetans around the world. Of all these horrors, the fact that China is actually seeking to reduce the population of Uighurs -- a Turkic minority of about 10 million with its own language and culture -- is especially disturbing. As Dr. Zenz notes in his report, these measures ""raise serious concerns"" that the policies amount to a violation of China's obligations under the U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, whose definition of genocide includes ""imposing measures intended to prevent births"" within a national, ethnic, racial or religious group targeted for destruction. China has sought for decades to control Xinjiang, an arid and mountainous region where the Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim people have long resented Beijing's repressive rule. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, China took to justifying harsh measures as needed to prevent terrorism, and in 2014 President Xi used bombing attacks by Uighur militants to begin what his government called a ""People's War on Terror."" The crackdown has intensified since then, with as many as a million members of ethnic minorities incarcerated in camps for forced ideological and behavioral indoctrination, along with a vast system of high-tech surveillance and forced assimilation. According to Dr. Zenz, a 2017 report from a local branch of the Xinjiang Ministry of Justice said the goal of the camps was to ""wash brains, cleanse hearts, support the right, remove the wrong.""

Dr. Zenz's latest report and a detailed investigation by The Associated Press charge that for some time now the campaign has included draconian measures to slash birthrates. These include regular pregnancy checks, enforced intrauterine devices, huge fines, sterilization and even abortions on hundreds of thousands of women, all backed by mass detention both as a threat and as punishment. Having too many children, which usually means three or more, is a major reason people are sent to detention camps. ""Police raid homes, terrifying parents as they search for hidden children,"" The A.P. reported. At the same time, the state has made efforts to transplant people of the majority Han population to the region and to have them intermarry with Uighurs. Last Thursday, the Senate adopted by unanimous consent a bill that would impose sanctions on Chinese officials, businesses and banks involved in the assault on Hong Kong's limited autonomy, and it is expected to sail through the House of Representatives. The week before that, Mr. Trump signed the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act, a bill that would potentially impose sanctions on Chinese officials over the prison camp system. The reaction from China was the usual bluster about ""fabricated"" or ""fake news"" and threats of ""countermeasures."" Mr. Trump's commitment to using these tools of statecraft to change China's behavior, however, is uncertain. In a signing statement accompanying the Uighur bill, the president said he would treat it as ""advisory and nonbinding."" The day he signed the act was also the day excerpts from John Bolton's tell-all book about his stint as national security adviser appeared, with his accounts of Mr. Trump's reluctance to let China's human rights transgressions get in the way of the trade deal he has long sought. Mr. Bolton recalled that at the opening dinner of the Group of 20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, in June 2019, Mr. Xi explained to Mr. Trump why he was building camps in Xinjiang. ""According to our interpreter,"" Mr. Bolton wrote in his book, ""Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do."" Still, the unanimous, bipartisan support for these bills, and Mr. Trump's signature on them, even if unenthusiastic, are an appropriately direct and clear signal to China that its behavior is contemptible and will have serious consequences. What remains is to make sure it does.",History will not be kind to those who did nothing to try to stop Beijing's human rights abuses.,4171a81f-8a11-560e-8536-e71e1ecc69cd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/02/opinion/02china_print/01china1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=99f1957a104a0d383f9297b4a2485a18c26caa0044179996e0f4cbc4b02e1ba2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Uighur child plays alone in the courtyard of a home at the Unity New Village in Hotan, in western China's Xinjiang region.",4171a81f-8a11-560e-8536-e71e1ecc69cd,Demo_data/D1_imgs/14171a81f-8a11-560e-8536-e71e1ecc69cd.jpg,11,20
Theater,Review: A Family Gropes for Words in 'Incidental Moments',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/theater/review-incidental-moments-of-the-day.html,"There is so much they all want -- no need -- to say. They have always been a family for whom conversation is as essential as oxygen, a means of defining and confirming their own identities in relation to one another and to the wide, heaving world that keeps shifting beyond and beneath them. Yet like every American in the late summer of 2020, the small, hope-hungry group of people at the center of ""Incidental Moments of the Day,"" Richard Nelson's truly profound new streaming play, is trapped in a moment of unprecedented turmoil and uncertainty. It's a time when saying anything can be dangerous, and words can become unwitting self-harming weapons. No, talking these days is nowhere near as easy as it used to be for the upstate New York clan known as the Apple family, about whom Nelson has written seven remarkable plays. In the latest, and perhaps last, of that cycle, a crippling self-consciousness informs every syllable they utter. The Apples -- whom I've known and loved for a decade now -- have never seemed more awkward, or more unsettlingly sad. ""Incidental Moments of the Day,"" which streamed live on YouTube on Thursday night and can be seen for free in its recorded version until Nov. 5, is the last of a trilogy of works written and directed by Nelson for the Zoom format, reflecting the way in which many people have found themselves communicating in the age of pandemic lockdown. When its main characters, the Apples, first showed up at the Public Theater in 2010, in a work called ""That Hopey Changey Thing,"" they inaugurated a new kind of town hall drama.

They and the similarly structured trilogy that followed -- about another family, the Gabriels, who lived in the same town (and were embodied by the same exceptional actors) -- were deceptively unassuming studies in the interpenetration of the personal and political in so-called ordinary lives. Though their names were mentioned infrequently, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump cast pervasive shadows in these plays. With the advent of Covid-19, Nelson's families, who customarily gathered around kitchen tables as if they were oases in a desert, were forced online. And Nelson turned communication by laptop into a consideration of the loneliness and longing to connect that many Americans were experiencing as they never had before. In the first of these plays, ""What Do We Need to Talk About?,"" which debuted at the end of April, the Apples were grappling with the disorientation of existing in their separate realms of confinement (despite all living in the same town). The second installment, ""And So We Come Forth,"" first seen in early July, took place when the grip of lockdown seemed to be loosening, and racial collisions vied with the pandemic for headlines.

Though Black Lives Matter had become one of the most ubiquitous and potent phrases in the world, racial division and injustice were barely touched upon, a troubling omission for some critics, including my colleague Jesse Green. Yet for me, the sense of a cultural revolution, inchoate still but powerful, resonated in everything the Apples didn't say in ""And So We Come Forth."" They were middle-aged, middle-class, small-town white people who had always thought of themselves as open-minded and progressive. But they also intuited that they might not be perceived that way in the new world that was taking shape without their assistance. The play was a portrait of people still hunkering down, and paralyzed not only by fear of a plague but of a changed society that might reject them.

In ""Incidental Moments,"" the strongest and deepest of the trilogy, the Apples have at last moved, fumblingly and hesitatingly, into the outside world. As the family's latest Zoom confab begins, only the youngest of the Apple siblings, Jane (Sally Murphy), a writer struggling with depression and agoraphobia, is in her own apartment. Her boyfriend, Tim (Stephen Kunken), an actor, is temporarily at his childhood home in Amherst, Mass. Marian Apple (Laila Robins) is still in Rhinebeck but out on a date (her first since the pandemic began) and eager to see what lurks behind the face mask of the man who asked her out. As for the oldest siblings, Richard and Barbara (Jay O. Sanders and Maryann Plunkett, husband and wife in real life), they're in Albany, dismantling the apartment he had kept there while he worked for Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Richard is moving back to Rhinebeck, but into his own place, rather than back into Barbara's house. He also has a new girlfriend. Their familial cohesiveness is crumbling, and their relations to one another no longer feel as reassuringly fixed. This makes them more tentative and faltering in their conversation, and you can see them flinching when sensitive spots are unintentionally bruised. The Zoom lens becomes, in this instance, an emotional X-ray machine, and each of the superb cast members here is even more eloquent in silence than in speech.

Tim tells the story of a Canadian acting troupe that had to shut down a production about that nation's Indigenous people because the cast, though multiracial, included no Indigenous actors. (Nelson appears to be thinking of the controversy around the Canadian theater artist Robert Lepage's ""Kanata"" two years ago.) James Baldwin and the white South African playwright Athol Fugard are quoted (by Tim) on the matter of who has the right to tell what stories. And Barbara feels, to her astonishment, that the world is shrinking. She says she once believed that she was ""part of some great humanity."" Now, she continues, ""it feels to me like we're making it all smaller and smaller .... This is -- yours, this is mine. These are the lines. These are the borders. The walls. Don't cross them. Or cross them at your own risk ..."" Plunkett, one of the great treasures of New York theater, delivers this speech not angrily but with a kind of bewildered mournfulness. Barbara says she misses humor in these somber days, and thinks it might be a good idea if they started telling one another jokes. And her bungling but self-delighted rendering of a silly joke has its own strange cathartic value. There's only one moment, though, in which everyone looks genuinely relaxed. That happens when a young woman named Lucy (Charlotte Bydwell), now working in France, performs a dance from her apartment. (For the record, she's a character from yet another Nelson Rhinebeck play, ""The Michaels,"" performed at the Public last year, and a character from ""The Gabriels"" is name-checked here, too.) It's a loopy little number, set to Scott Joplin, that finds the grace in slapstick awkwardness. For its short and sweet duration, everyone watching her smiles without strain. It feels right that a wordless piece of art offers the play's characters their one full moment of blessed transcendence. Incidental Moments of the Day

Sports,Can Democracy Work in Soccer?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/sports/soccer/can-democracy-work-in-soccer.html,"These may be the last days in office for Josep Maria Bartomeu, Barcelona's embattled, unpopular president. An insurgent group, frustrated by the decline of the team and furious at how close the club came to losing the star forward Lionel Messi, has succeeded in collecting the signatures of more than 16,000 members required to call for a vote of no confidence in his board. The walls are closing in. Bartomeu must now choose an interim candidate to take his post while he awaits the results of a referendum on his leadership. If he survives that vote, he will remain in his post until the club holds elections in March. If he does not -- if 66 percent of those who vote turn against him -- he will be deposed, and the presidential election will be brought forward to January. Or, as one of the leaders of the movement against him, Jordi Farre, said, Bartomeu could fall on his sword. He could resign, saving himself the ordeal of a toxic election campaign that would serve only to heighten divisions with the club and its fan base, and take his board -- the board that almost cost the club the greatest player in its history -- with him.

Bartomeu's judge and his jury on those charges will be the club's fans, or at least its members. Barcelona, like three other teams in Spain -- Athletic Bilbao, Osasuna and Real Madrid -- as well as the vast majority of clubs in Germany, Turkey and Sweden (and at many major clubs in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay) is a democracy. There is power, but there is also control. There is accountability, in a way essentially impossible in the ""ownership neutral"" world of English soccer, where each club exists as an entity part way between a business and a fief. And that is, without question, A Good Thing. But it is also only one side of the story. Because while democracy provides the mechanism that allows Barcelona's members to wrest power from Bartomeu, it also may explain quite how it all came to this.

In theory, of course, an elected president should think about a club's long-term health: investing in youth, bolstering the recruitment department, diversifying revenue streams, striking sponsorship deals. Bartomeu did some of that. He also dedicated himself to trying to turn Barcelona into a beacon of modernity; he spoke about wanting the club to be the Silicon Valley of soccer. That is the theory; the practice is different. In practice, an electoral approach encourages instant gratification. It is why, invariably, candidates for club elections in Spain promise to bring in a specific coach or sign a certain player. All of the long-term planning might win minds, but any president knows that, to retain power, conquering hearts is much more significant. And so Bartomeu responded to the loss of Neymar in 2017 by spending vast -- and, with the benefit of hindsight, unwarranted -- sums on Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele. When, in 2019, Barcelona's squad was crying out for a new generation, he signed ... Antoine Griezmann. He dispensed with Ernesto Valverde, a competent but uninspiring coach, despite not having a replacement. Part of that, of course, is his poor judgment, a testament to a gift for appointing the wrong people at the wrong time. But part of it is an inevitable byproduct of a structure that discourages stability. When a club president knows there is always a reckoning around the corner, they must always be in electoral mode. They must always be searching for ways to sate their public. They are always thinking about bread and circuses.

And for the most part, it works. German clubs are stable. Few live beyond their means. The boom-and-bust economics of England and Italy, say, are unthinkable. Fans' rights are protected, their voices heard. Games are held in sleek, modern stadiums. Television's influence is moderated. Tickets are reasonably priced. It is, to many, a model soccer culture. It is not, though, without its problems. The democracy that underpins the system is hardly the Pnyx: It can be, at times, superficial, not quite a Banana Republic but little more than a rubber stamp, with clubs' power structures dominated by unmoving cliques and vulnerable to factionalism. Economically, there are far more people working in clubs in Germany than would ever admit it in public who believe that, in order to compete in the long-term, the 50+1 rule that guarantees fan control must either be modified or lifted. (It is to the credit of the rule's supporters that they do not see ""competing"" with clubs artificially supported by nation states as an admirable goal.) Socially, it tends to ensure Germany's clubs remain in the grip of (mostly) men who are (mostly) of a certain age and a particular, small-c conservative mind-set, and that younger, more diverse voices are often locked out of the conversation. German clubs can be unwieldy, cumbersome and resistant to change. That is not necessarily a weakness, but nor is it necessarily a strength. Besides, there is little proof that Germany is a rule. Every club in Turkey is owned by its members. Every president is on the permanent treadmill of election and re-election. The result, in a country where prominence in soccer brings substantial political capital, is almost permanent chaos. Many there are convinced that the only way to restore the health of the country's soccer culture is to allow private investment: not just to pay down crippling, insurmountable debts but to encourage efficiency, to prevent power-hungry presidents from spending vast sums of borrowed money on fading stars to try to protect their own positions.

It is easy to rail against the amount of money that drifts out of soccer and into the hands of agents, but to present them as nothing more than leeches is unfair. Good agents provide a valuable service; as we have seen during the coronavirus pandemic, not all clubs can be trusted to be caring, responsible employers. The problem is not with the existence of agents; it is with the scale of the gray areas in which they are allowed to operate. Two details from my colleague Tariq Panja's reporting on yet another wonderful summer for Jorge Mendes stood out. The first is the potential conflict of interest present in the sort of deal that took Matt Doherty from Wolves to Tottenham: a player represented by Mendes leaving a club in which Mendes has considerable influence -- as a business partner of the owner and the representative of the manager -- for one where another of his clients is the coach. The second is more troubling. Mendes can earn a fee from a deal not just as the agent of a player, but as the beneficiary of a mandate from a club to sell a player: a public listing from F.C. Porto shows he received millions of dollars for helping to move the striker Fabio Silva to (you guessed it) Wolves.

Somewhere in the region of 48 hours had elapsed, at a guess, between you receiving last week's newsletter and Liverpool's taking the field at Villa Park on Sunday. We do not need to dwell, particularly, on what happened next, but suffice to say that over the next 90 minutes it did not look like either Virgil van Dijk or Joe Gomez had much of an aura. Defeats happen, of course; nobody ever said van Dijk was invincible. He is as entitled to an off day, a bad performance, as anyone else. But what happened at Villa Park was no ordinary loss: The fact of defeat is immaterial, but the nature of it is not. It will be intriguing to watch, then, what effect that humiliation at the hands of Ollie Watkins has on both van Dijk and his reputation. Will opposition teams now be less intimidated by his supposed impermeability, now that Aston Villa has proved, spectacularly, that it is not necessarily a permanent state? Will his teammates be less assured by his mere presence? Will his self-confidence be affected? Will his errors attract more attention? What happens to van Dijk now is, in a sense, a test of whether an aura, once acquired, can be broken. It might yet be a test of whether an aura, once broken, can be reassembled.

Bob Harrison, meanwhile, is on hand to point out one of the accepted banalities of soccer coverage: the sort of thing we all accept but that, when you actually think about it, doesn't make a vast amount of sense. ""When fourth officials first started holding up a board showing how much added time there would be, broadcasters broke away from actual play to show it,"" he wrote. ""It was new. I get that. But how long has it been going? 20 years? We really don't need to see it."" This is true. We don't. They could just tell us. Though I guess people who are hard of hearing might appreciate it? Or people who, like me, tend to watch soccer games with the sound off while attempting to entertain children? Maybe a good rule would be: Show it when the ball is out of play. Don't cut away from the game for it. And a strong start from Ajoy Vachher, who described my assertion -- expressed here -- that perhaps the Premier League doesn't always live up to its own billing as the best league in the world as ""hogwash."" ""To suggest the differentiator is 'crowd noise,' or focus on spectacle rather than the quality and intensity of soccer, is so ... completely and utterly wrong, it calls into question your opinion and take on just about anything related to soccer.""",The effort to oust Barcelona's unpopular president has shown the power of fans.

Dance,Review: 'Velocity' Has Fast Feet and Some Lingering Irish Dance Clichés,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/arts/dance/review-velocity-new-victory-theater.html,"""What even is Irish dance -- is it just, like, 'Riverdance'?"" a smart colleague asked me on Saturday at the New Victory Theater, before a matinee of David Geaney and James Devine's new family-friendly Irish dance-and-music show, ""Velocity.""

Irish dance, of course, is much more than ""Riverdance."" But in bringing worldwide attention to a previously provincial dance form, that commercially successful extravaganza (which is still around after more than 20 years) became synonymous with Irish dance for many new to the upright, fleet-footed style. It also spawned innumerable spinoffs, supplying formulas with which Irish dancers and choreographers continue to reckon, whether they know it or not.

At first, the energetic ""Velocity,"" more intimate history lesson than sequined spectacular, appears to buck cliche. The small cast -- just four dancers -- limits the well-worn use of Rockettes-inspired unison; Mr. Geaney, a five-time world Irish dance champion, and Mr. Devine, who is said to hold the world record for fastest feet (38 taps per second), are joined by AnneMarie Keaney and Gabriella Wood. The terrific music, played live onstage, leans toward the traditional, with the notable exceptions of some percussive experimentation (by the ecstatic Moises Mas Garcia) and the turntable scratching of Jack McMahon.","This energetic show is part intimate history lesson, part advertisement for its leads.",dd241d11-c7cc-5ddb-ab20-1c529fe5e06b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/20/arts/20velocity-1/merlin_146958630_ee5ce235-9ef2-4618-960e-e8d4b9127e39-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=477c331beed2b995f4ebb350408078d4183958a6d988577084fde3b0ab1bce82&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"James Devine, left, and David Geaney in ""Velocity"" at the New Victory Theater.",dd241d11-c7cc-5ddb-ab20-1c529fe5e06b,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1dd241d11-c7cc-5ddb-ab20-1c529fe5e06b.jpg,6,10
Health,Officials Preparing for Zika Virus to Spread in the U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/health/zika-virus-outbreak-united-states.html,"Officials Preparing for Zika Virus to Spread in the U.S.

WASHINGTON -- The federal government, preparing for homegrown cases of the Zika virus, is planning to release a proposal for responding to them, health officials said Friday. The 60-page document, a blueprint for action when the first cases of locally transmitted Zika occur in the continental United States, could be released early next week, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. They emphasized that it was a working draft that could change based on advice from state officials. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, and Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., spoke by videoconference with state governors Thursday about the plan. On Friday, experts with the C.D.C. talked with state health departments.

The Zika virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito -- a bug that in the United States is found mostly in the South and Southwest, though its range can spread in the summer. No one has been infected with Zika by a mosquito in the continental United States, but health experts expect it to happen. The health experts do not expect an explosive Zika virus transmission like the recent one in Brazil because many homes in the United States are air-conditioned and keep their windows closed. Many also have screened windows that keep mosquitoes out. The United States is much less densely populated than the areas of Brazil where the Zika outbreak occurred, a hindrance to transmission given that the Aedes aegypti mosquito rarely flies more than a block in its lifetime. Many health experts worry, however, that a Zika outbreak could be difficult to fight because 80 percent of the people infected with it experience no symptoms. ""If we have a homegrown case, that's a game changer,"" Dr. Thomas E. Dobbs III, Mississippi's epidemiologist, said in a telephone interview.

Zika causes debilitating birth defects, including abnormally small heads and damaged brains from a condition called microcephaly. Health officials are focusing on protecting pregnant women from exposure to mosquitoes or people infected with the Zika virus. The disease can be sexually transmitted, too. At the heart of the plan are the C.D.C.'s multidisciplinary rapid-response teams. They will provide state and local governments with technical and logistical expertise, epidemiology, laboratory services and advice on fighting mosquitoes. The C.D.C. has used rapid-response teams for years to track many diseases. ""We know that this is a critical time,"" Dr. Schuchat said. ""It's really the time to get ready."" If the disease spreads like its cousins -- dengue and chikungunya -- experts say they expect there to be individual cases that are essentially one-offs, not large clusters that spread. Still, Dr. Schuchat cautioned that health officials were not going to assume that Zika would behave that way. ""The first case is an important event,"" she said. She added that it might not be immediately clear whether the case came from a local mosquito until there were several, and that doctors, hospitals and local health authorities needed to be particularly vigilant.","No one has contracted Zika from a mosquito in the continental United States, but health experts expect it to happen, so they are drafting a plan.",6f8249a0-91c0-5b6a-b06c-e05fc404bfc9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/11/science/11ZIKA-web/11ZIKA-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=75b2c4b487684ac8292a23b9739b899a1c0d15b6c55b1ad7bd9c97cbb1660593&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Delfina Tirado, an inspector with mosquito control in Miami-Dade County, Fla., checked a home for the Aedes aegypti mosquito and its larvae in March.

Science,"Under Pressure, F.D.A. Adds Measures on Opioid Abuse",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/health/under-pressure-fda-adds-measures-on-opioid-abuse.html,"Under pressure from Congress to take action amid a worsening opioid epidemic, the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced several measures aimed at dealing with abuse.

Dr. Robert Califf, the acting commissioner and nominee to run the agency, announced the measures in a phone conference with reporters. He said the steps were an attempt by the agency to toughen its response to the crisis, in which tens of thousands of Americans were addicted to the prescription painkillers and were dying of overdoses. He said the actions were part of a broader government effort: Earlier this week, the Obama administration said it would ask Congress to spend an additional $1.1 billion next year on the problem, which would help increase badly needed treatment facilities.

""It has reached a point where we felt we had to step back and take a careful look at everything and see what we could do,"" Dr. Califf said. ""We thought we could do more.""

Fashion & Style,The Death of Fashion Diplomacy,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/fashion/the-death-of-fashion-diplomacy.html,"Credit...Pool photo by Doug Mills



So the Trump state visit to the United Kingdom, with its Irish interlude and European D-Day sojourn, full of carefully choreographed, performative posturing, has come to an end. We know only some details of what was discussed -- Brexit! Trade! Tiffany brooches! -- but visual souvenirs of the Trumps' attire abound on the digisphere. In the absence of further information about what went on behind closed doors, we are left to mine the formal photo ops for clues ; to parse the hats, formal wear and coats . After all, this is a White House that prizes pageantry and theater, and embraces them as strategic tools -- costume included. The trip was predicated on symbolism, and in such context, all public choices have imp ort. Yet we still can't agree on what it all meant. Just as the endless stream of name-calling and off-the-cuff remarks from the president has served to numb us to their content, so too has the elaborate stream of obfuscating outfits. Each one opened itself to multiple interpretations from critics and armchair observers around the world, tempting division and dissent through speculation.

Or maybe Mrs. Trump was being diplomatic by arriving and departing in the British heritage brand Burberry (a pussy-bow-print blouse splashed with the word ""society"" on the way in, and a trench coat as she left). Or no, she was ignoring all that by wearing the French brand Dior to the formal state dinner. Perhaps she represented the United States by wearing a white coat from The Row to the British D-Day ceremony. Whoops, maybe not, because the day before she wore a belted-up trench dress from another European brand, Celine. (Then again, it was old Celine, from the Phoebe Philo years, so it could have been a feminist gesture.)

The only thing not in dispute is how expensive much of it was. Because the Trumps actually buy their clothes off the rack, it is possible to find and price them all (except the Dior couture gown worn to the state dinner, which is made to order and priced on application): the Burberry blouse costing PS650 ($825), the Gucci a cool PS2,615 ($3,319), the Givenchy, $8,340. When it came to the Celine trench and the white coat from The Row, she shopped her closet.

Maybe the choice was part of the trade war posturing. Whatever! So it was expensive. Whatever! So it wasn't American or British or consistently diplomatic. Whatever. She looked good, if a little like she had just stepped off a film set -- buttoned-up, contained and opaque as usual. What really got people worked up in regards to the Trumps' wardrobe was the president's white-tie faux pas: a too-long vest under his tailcoat at the state dinner. Why that sort of excess should have been a surprise is unclear. As his penchant for oversize ties and suits (and crowds) shows, the president clearly believes in exaggeration of all kinds. And given his absolute surety that his way is the right way and the current let-Trump-be-Trump attitude of his White House, who would tell him otherwise? Not the secretary of treasury (and appropriately vested) Steven Mnuchin.

The true revelation of this particular sartorial parade has been how fast our expectations for executive-branch appearance, honed over multiple administrations and historical examples from the Kennedys on, have evaporated -- in this as in so much else. Two years ago, when Mr. Trump first took office, there was a presumption that Mrs. Trump, reluctant as she was to play the first lady game, would nevertheless be canny with her clothes: she had been a model, after all. She wore all-American to the inauguration. She understood what could be read into a photograph (and if she didn't, or her team didn't, that ""I Really Don't Care, Do U?"" coat brouhaha would have been all the learning experience needed). Yet again and again she has chipped away at the practice, previously considered a real tool of soft power, a way to subtly support local industry or suggest outreach to a host country. It's clear she understands the precedent -- she wore Chanel to the French state dinner last year ( because why? Accident? Doubtful !) -- but not how she decides when to break it.

It's gotten so confusing that in London, when her stepdaughter Ivanka wore a fussy white peplum jacket and pleated skirt by Alessandra Rich on the first day -- going so far as to pop on a fascinator a la Ascot -- and then opted for Carolina Herrera for the state dinner, followed by Burberry polka dots to meet with Theresa May, a classic British-American-British nod to the special relationship, practically no one noticed. Now it seems almost quaint, the belief that a first lady should use her wardrobe to advance a recognizable, if subtle, domestic or diplomatic point. Such a charming, old-fashioned relic of a different time. Like when we also expected our leaders to believe when they represent the nation, they represent all people. And yet that doesn't mean there is no agenda involved. It's just not the one we are used to. In their own specific way, the Trumps actually are doing what their forbearers did: using their clothing to reflect their approach to governance. It's just that their approach seems to rely on the startling, the eye-catching and the politically incorrect. In dress, it is increasingly apparent, as it is on Twitter.",White-tie faux pas? Hat tricks?

Automobiles,"Cadillac Has New Boss, New Address and Big Plans",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/21/automobiles/cadillac-has-new-boss-new-address-and-big-plans-for-a-revival.html,"Can a South African-born former Audi executive, who recently spurned Japanese masters in Hong Kong, lead a Detroit luxury brand back to greatness -- and from a new base in Manhattan? Johan de Nysschen and Cadillac are about to find out. After a string of failed revival attempts through the '70s and '90s -- think the Cimarron -- Cadillac harnessed aggressive design and performance to put its old-timey image largely in the past. Yet its comeback has stalled. Cadillac's American sales have slumped 2 percent in 2015, even as its German rivals Mercedes, BMW and Audi set one sales record after another. For General Motors, another post-bankruptcy executive shake-up was in order. Last fall, it hired Mr. de Nysschen, one of the industry's most prominent leaders, who helped lead Audi of America to sales heights before Nissan chose him to lead its Infiniti division from offices in Hong Kong. But Mr. de Nysschen cast his gaze eastward. After more than a century in the Motor City, Cadillac is revamping as a separate G.M. unit, moving to new Manhattan headquarters in SoHo to take the pulse of this luxury-crazed international city.

G.M. will also invest $12 billion by 2020 to develop eight new Cadillac models, including the crossover sport utility vehicles that have been conspicuously absent from the lineup. ""How is it possible that we have so few crossovers from this iconic American luxury brand?"" Mr. de Nysschen said. ""The Germans have more than I can count on two hands."" One answer, he suggests, is that Cadillac has often been overshadowed in G.M.'s Midwest empire. Cadillac design and engineering will remain in the Eero Saarinen-designed G.M. Technical Center in suburban Detroit, itself the recipient of a $1 billion investment and up to 2,600 new jobs. But Mr. de Nysschen insists that the relocation isn't window dressing. Staying in Detroit, ""We'd be such a small part of the constellation that we'd get whittled down to the lowest common denominator,"" Mr. de Nysschen said. ""By changing geography, you force a change."" Michael Harley, editor in chief of Autoweb, said that ""Cadillac has tried to revive themselves over and over, but it was always a halfhearted effort. But by splitting the brand off, they're taking a more serious approach.""

The less-provincial outlook includes another bid to make Cadillac an international player by tailoring cars to buyers in China and Europe. To become a true ""challenger brand,"" Mr. de Nysschen said, it must also beat the Germans at the global luxury game they dominate. Cadillac models like the ATS and CTS sedans have received awards and critical praise for outperforming those German rivals. The buyers haven't always followed. When the price of the enlarged and lavishly re-engineered CTS shot into BMW and Mercedes territory, at more than $60,000 for loaded versions, not enough consumers were prepared for the richer version, Mr. de Nysschen said. Cadillac was forced to idle a Michigan assembly plant for three weeks to trim bloated inventories of the slow-selling ATS and CTS. In hindsight, Mr. de Nysschen said, Cadillac might have simply renamed the CTS to make clear that it was more deluxe, ambitious and, yes, expensive than before. Yana Paskova for The New York Times Mr. Harley said that the CTS's struggles show how hard it is to compete against German brands that sell not just on design or performance, but also on their badges and status. ""De Nysschen has to sell the image, the idea that you want a Cadillac in your driveway instead of a Mercedes,"" he said. ""And that's a tough road."" That disconnect between Cadillac's critical standing and its lagging reputation and sales helped drive the change of perspective for its sales and marketing teams. One goal, Mr. de Nysschen said, is to draw on luxury experts beyond the auto industry and to ""see and live the lifestyle of actual luxury customers.""

""New York isn't where American trends begin; this is where global trends begin,"" he said. Jessica Caldwell, director of industry analysis for Edmunds.com, said that Cadillac continued to suffer from a perception issue. ""Cadillac is making pretty compelling cars, but the sales needle hasn't moved too much,"" she said ""It can be turned around, as Audi has done, but it takes a long time."" Industry watchers, especially in Detroit, have expressed skepticism over the corporate move, which could eventually see perhaps 200 employees on the leased top two floors of 330 Hudson Street in Manhattan. But Ms. Caldwell said the relocation could help revive Cadillac by attracting young talent from top Eastern universities who cannot be lured to struggling Detroit. ""At this point, Cadillac has to take some risks,"" she said. Some risks have paid off. Others have not. A redesigned Escalade, that club-friendly, high-wattage sport utility vehicle, scored an unexpected hit in an era of bargain gasoline prices. Those same fuel prices did no favors for the ELR: The $75,000 plug-in hybrid coupe bombed so badly in showrooms that Cadillac had to chop $9,000 from its price. And the brand's CUE infotainment system has been reviled by critics. Mr. de Nysschen said Cadillac must continue to take calculated risks and even accept setbacks ""that the old G.M. wouldn't have contemplated."" ""If you punish setbacks, you stifle innovation,"" he said. To that end, Cadillac is developing its own twin-turbocharged 4- and 8-cylinder engines that won't be shared with other G.M. brands. Late this year, Cadillac will introduce the XT5, a midsize crossover, to replace the aging SRX. That will be followed by the CT6, a full-size luxury flagship in the vein of the formidable Mercedes S-Class. The rest of the cavalry, including critical small cars and crossovers, will arrive from late 2018 through 2020. It is a long view, but as Mr. de Nysschen sees it, a healthy Cadillac is crucial to G.M.'s success. Around the world, he said, luxury cars deliver only 10 to 12 percent of industry sales but 50 percent of its profits. Cadillac is G.M.'s only luxury brand, and without its high profit margins, G.M. will struggle to fund critical technology and the low-margin economy cars that it must sell to meet rising fuel economy standards.

""If we wait even 10 years, it will be too late,"" Mr. de Nysschen said. To woo buyers in Europe, where Cadillac has struggled to gain a foothold, the brand will develop diesel engines and right-hand-drive models. As Cadillac styles and engineers its global cars, the enormous Chinese market will never be far from mind. In the United States, Cadillac will tolerate lower sales volumes for now to bolster its image and the values of new and used models. That effort is beginning to pay dividends, Ms. Caldwell said. Cadillac's average retail transaction price has risen 6 percent over the last year to $53,700, far beyond those of Audi or Lexus and close to Mercedes and BMW at around $55,000. As Mr. de Nysschen moved from temporary quarters in Detroit to Brooklyn, he got his own taste of rising prices -- for New York real estate. Over dinner at a Japanese restaurant in the Williamsburg neighborhood, Mr. de Nysschen said he had been outbid on multiple properties, mainly in Manhattan, before buying a home in Hoboken, N.J., that he and his wife, Anna, who hails from suburban Detroit, are renovating. ""Someone clearly has a lot more money than me,"" he said, bemoaning his luck.","Cadillac, which has moved to Manhattan, used aggressive design and performance to put its old image in the past, but that comeback has since stalled.",c879e1cf-6e4e-5194-889e-beca281d02fd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/21/business/21wheels-web/21wheels-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=2a9c3118aab36188cde648ff60c60784f2108b1900130376426874d2726c353e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"For Cadillac to become a true ""challenger brand,"" said Johan de Nysschen, the new president, it must also beat the Germans at the global luxury game they dominate.",c879e1cf-6e4e-5194-889e-beca281d02fd,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1c879e1cf-6e4e-5194-889e-beca281d02fd.jpg,23,23
Fashion & Style,Nasty Gal's Path to Bankruptcy,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/fashion/nasty-gal-sophia-amoruso-bankruptcy.html,"With the rise of the ""nasty woman"" meme comes a decline in the fortunes of the Nasty Gal brand. Nasty Gal is an e-commerce darling founded in 2006 by Sophia Amoruso and a model of social-media-driven millennial entrepreneurship. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 9 to secure financial relief while it restructures. The company, which sells its own collection, vintage pieces and items from other brands, will continue to run its business and has asserted that customers and employees will see no change in day-to-day operations. There are also reports that Ms. Amoruso, who ceded her role as chief executive to Sheree Waterson in 2015, will resign from her current post as executive chairwoman, and that Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, which invested nearly $50 million in Nasty Gal in 2012, will step down from the board. Nasty Gal hasn't confirmed these moves and did not offer any additional comments. The news may come as a surprise for those who have followed Nasty Gal's seemingly endless upward trajectory. By the end of 2015, Forbes estimated that the company surpassed $300 million in revenues (up from a reported $10 million in 2010), and this year internet Retailer estimated that Nasty Gal's five-year compound growth rate was 92.4 percent, compared with a median 15.3 percent among online apparel sites.

The company has been courted by Urban Outfitters, has attracted venture capitalists for years, and opened its first brick-and-mortar store in Los Angeles in 2014, followed the next year by one in Santa Monica, Calif. Just last summer, the Council of Fashion Designers of America inducted Ms. Amoruso into its hallowed halls, and Forbes added her to its list of America's richest self-made women, estimating her fortune at $280 million and ranking her above Beyonce and Taylor Swift. But as Allison Enright, an editor at internet Retailer, pointed out, growth and solvency are two different things. ""They were able to grow their sales very quickly,"" she said. ""But you can always grow really fast and not make any money."" Julie Zerbo, founder of The Fashion Law website, pointed to a host of legal troubles as well, including lawsuits from designers alleging copyright infringement and from employees charging discrimination. In 2011 the company was a co-defendant in a lawsuit filed by the Hells Angels for trademark infringement, and in 2014, Jamies Spinello sued Nasty Gal, maintaining that it copied one of her necklace designs; this year, Pamela Love did the same over three jewelry designs. ""Suing and getting sued requires a ton of resources,"" Ms. Zerbo said. With the limited information that's available about Nasty Gal's balance sheet (the company isn't publicly traded), the picture that's emerging is one of rapid growth, built largely around the personality of Nasty Gal's founder and undercut by mismanagement and legal stumbles.

Ms. Amoruso, 32, was 22 years old when she created the first iteration of Nasty Gal, an eBay store selling vintage clothes that grew its customer base through Myspace. Over the next several years, she built a following and expanded the company through an engaged presence on social media; Nasty Gal now has almost 1.3 million followers on Facebook and 2.2 million on Instagram. With so many brand ambassadors at its disposal, Nasty Gal quickly became synonymous with affordable, chic, yet slightly gritty cool-girl style -- similar to Ms. Amoruso's own look. The Sophia Amoruso brand was integral to Nasty Gal's success, a fact that Ms. Amoruso herself is fully aware of. ""Everyone knows Nasty Gal requires me,"" she told Forbes this summer. Her image is founded on her style (elegant, with a sexy edge), her social circles (she counts Leandra Medine of Man Repeller and Lena Dunham among her friends) and her ""Cinderella story"" (Ms. Amoruso, a community-college dropout, wrote about how she used to commit petty theft and Dumpster dive as a teenager).","After years of rapid growth, the fashion apparel website founded by Sophia Amoruso filed for chapter 11 protection on Wednesday.",6f096615-cd08-5b0f-95f7-e8b77f19dc45,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/17/fashion/11NASTYP/11NASTYP-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=797bfe9419cc20170525688158ab7f3074933bdcf4a58e05c29a22c695ef750f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sophia Amoruso, founder of Nasty Gal, at a brunch in Los Angeles.",6f096615-cd08-5b0f-95f7-e8b77f19dc45,Demo_data/D1_imgs/16f096615-cd08-5b0f-95f7-e8b77f19dc45.jpg,19,19
Travel,"Hotels, Feeling the Pinch of Airbnb, Promote Local Experiences",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/travel/hotels-feeling-the-pinch-of-airbnb-promote-local-experiences.html,"""Tourist"" has become a dirty word in the hospitality business. The preferred word? Local. Travelers can now sign up through hotels and tour operators for experiences arranged by locals. The latest to join the trend are Marriott International, which recently took a stake in PlacePass, the tour- and activity-booking start-up, and Royal Caribbean Cruises, which just introduced GoBe, a seller -- online and through an app -- of land-based tours and activities. The experiences can be as varied as the grand and the unexpected. On PlacePass, guests can book a private tour of ""Downton Abbey"" filming locations, pasta-making lessons with a local celebrity chef or family-friendly outings. The new moves by these established companies reflect the increasing draw of home-sharing sites like Airbnb, which promise travelers the chance to live like a local, said Fiona O'Donnell, the director of travel and leisure research at Mintel, a market research firm, in Chicago. ""Guests want to feel like they are experiencing something in the design or the local flavor,"" she said. ""They want it to be memorable and part of the local scene, not like they are tourists.""

The moves are also an extension of a trend where hotels are moving away from a uniform experience, no matter where they are, to one in which properties blend into their communities and offer travelers access to local artists and businesses. Hotel operators already have a trove of data about the preferences and behavior of their frequent guests, said Bjorn Hanson, a professor at the Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University. Now, he said, the hotels are using that data to get travelers to spend more money when they visit. ""Growth is slowing, so they have to shift their model to target more spending"" per guest, he said. Last year, Airbnb started its own Trips booking site, on which local ""experts"" sell experiences they put together, like a seven-hour day working and dining in an urban garden with a Los Angeles documentary filmmaker, or a three-day burlesque dancing class in London, complete with a workshop on making nipple tassels. TripAdvisor, the online travel booking site, bought Viator three years ago. The booking site's nonhotel revenue rose 31 percent last year, while revenue from its main hotel-booking business was down slightly. The start-up Hello Scout offers concierge service and activities booking via its website and text message for independent boutique hotels in six cities, including New York, San Francisco and Seattle. Hotel guests use it to text local experts to book events, or find restaurants or other hangouts. Travelers pay a fee for the bookings, and the service is free to the hotels.

There are also start-ups that connect travelers with locals for dining-in experiences, like BonAppetour, where guests can book lunch or dinner at the home of a chef in Rome or go to a Parisian dinner party in a 19th-century apartment near the Champs-Elysees. At the Stafford Hotel in London, the executive concierge, Frank Laino, created and is the host of a walking tour for guests to his favorite places in the St. James neighborhood, including visits to places not open to the public like Spencer House, Princess Diana's ancestral home, and Lock & Company, the world's oldest hat shop. Marriott's investment in PlacePass -- the amount wasn't disclosed -- adds to its existing membership rewards program, which it had been building into an ""experiences marketplace,"" where points could be redeemed for local music, sports, food and dining, and cultural activities. The technology will be incorporated into the mobile app that hotel rewards members use to check in and out and to unlock their room doors. Marriott is using big data technology to analyze and interpret customer activity on the app and to make suggestions about PlacePass experiences to try, whether or not that customer is currently staying at a Marriott property. ""Marriott is adding value to consumer lives besides just a bed in a hotel room,"" Stephanie Linnartz, the company's global chief commercial officer, said. Marriott sees its Moxy brand as a boutique hotel with the heart of a hostel, Vicki Poulos, the brand director, said. The hotels are typically in urban settings that are destinations for travelers seeking a new experience, Ms. Poulos said, different from a hotel in a suburb where travelers are not necessarily staying over to learn something new. ""We're really making sure we infuse that local culture,"" she said. ""People are determined to get to know what the community has to offer.""

Its Times Square location is set to open this summer, to be followed by a second site in Manhattan and three others in Denver, London and Seattle. Rooms in the Times Square hotel and others are 183 square feet, creating a space challenge in keeping with living in the Big Apple. Moxy calls this ""urban camping,"" and has installed wall pegs to move furniture off the ground and make room for yoga, Ms. Poulos said. Another brand that Marriott inherited with its acquisition of Starwood Hotels last year, Aloft Hotels, sponsors live music performances by area artists. Hilton Hotels' budget Canopy and higher-end Curio brands also draw on the local scene. The Darcy, which opened this spring in the Logan Circle neighborhood of Washington, is a Curio hotel that will feature local celebrity chefs and room service with drinks featuring locally made Green Hat Gin and other products. Radisson Red, which recently opened in Minneapolis and is set to expand into other markets in the United States next year, has an app that allows checked-in guests to talk to one another in a group forum, share tips for the best nearby restaurants and bars and arrange meetups. For travelers who are combining work and play, ""you want to check things out,"" Heather Boschke, Radisson Red's brand manager, said. ""You want to see something new and different.""","A tour of Princess Diana's ancestral home, performances by local musicians: Hotels are seeking to offer more than just a place to sleep.",01cd1eed-8270-512a-b378-8ceebe8b290b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/29/business/30ITINERARIES/30ITINERARIES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=cdf1518ac655ec3c1227a10e929fa7e5737660c34cc1c9612d4d2e6a2f1a4705&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A rendering of a room in the Marriott Moxy hotel in Times Square, set to open this summer.

Media,A Media Critic Focuses on the Crisis in Local News,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/media/margaret-sullivan-local-news.html,"Before she became a media columnist, Margaret Sullivan saw the crisis in the American newspaper industry from within. She spent roughly three decades at The Buffalo News and was the first woman to serve as its top editor, a job she held from 1999 to 2012. ""For years, it seemed like it had a license to print money,"" Ms. Sullivan writes in her first book, ""Ghosting the News: Local Journalism and the Crisis of American Democracy,"" which was published Tuesday. But like many papers, the Buffalo daily has become a reduced version of what it once was. Berkshire Hathaway sold it to the Lee Enterprises chain this year after Berkshire's multibillionaire chief executive, Warren E. Buffett, said most newspapers were ""toast."" Ms. Sullivan went on to be the public editor of The New York Times, a post that put her close to the journalists and newsroom leaders whose work she scrutinized as a representative of the paper's readers. The Times eliminated the position, in a much-debated move, about a year into the tenure of her successor, Liz Spayd.

Since leaving the paper in 2016, Ms. Sullivan has kept watch over the news industry as The Washington Post's media columnist. She spoke from her cottage in Evans, N.Y., near Lake Erie and not far from her hometown, Lackawanna. This interview has been edited and condensed. When were you first bitten by the journalism bug? When I was in early high school, the Watergate hearings were taking place, and my family was gathered around the TV in the living room and we were mesmerized. How did your time in Buffalo inform your outlook on the local news crisis? The newsroom that I came to was thriving, vibrant. It had newspaper competition down the street. And, fairly quickly, the competition went out of business. We had a number of very profitable years, and then structural changes came about, starting in 2008 or 2009, and I was the editor at that time. We were doing round after round of buyouts throughout the company, including the newsroom. We could no longer cover things the way we used to. I could see firsthand that these changes were hurting the community.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. There's a lot in your book about the importance of community. Why is that function of newspapers important to you? I was the features editor for several years. We had a pop music critic, a classical music critic, a drama critic, an art critic, plus reporters who wrote about other elements of the community that had nothing to do with watchdog journalism. There was a section that, with the help of staff, I founded, Life & Arts. That section, which was in the paper Monday through Friday, no longer exists. When I stay at my cottage near Lake Erie in the summer, and I get the print edition, I always feel like something's missing.

Was what happened to local journalism inevitable? Or was there a moment where things could have gone differently? Traditional media companies could have responded to the changes much more nimbly. There was a whole thing about ""Should we or shouldn't we charge for the content of the paper?"" For a long time, local newspapers decided not to. It never made any sense, because it costs lots of money to produce this journalism. We were very slow to take advantage of the particular strengths of the internet in a way that might have made a real difference. The kind of work we do now -- some newspapers, including The Times and The Post, present things in a way that's much better than the way they're presented in print. But for the longest time, newspapers, especially local newspapers, were just shoveling their content onto the web and expecting people to like it. It was smug. It was slow. And it hurt us. Does some blame lie with the Wall Street-backed companies that have become newspaper owners? Hedge-fund ownership is one of, if not the, worst developments that have occurred for newspapers. These companies don't care about journalism. They care about strip-mining what's left for whatever profits can be squeezed, not with an eye to a sustainable future but with an eye toward next quarter's balance sheet. How do you look back on your four years as public editor of The Times? I'm sure this may sound sappy or sentimental or pandering or something bad, but I really found it to be a privilege. I approached it as a service that I wanted to do as well as I could. And it was very tough, at times, to come into the building every day and feel part of a great institution, but also know that your role was to critique and, to some extent, to find fault. But I tried to keep in mind that the people I was really working for were the readers of The Times, so that it wasn't about making people within the institution happy. The Post also did away with its ombudsman. Are outlets well served by having such a position? Some places are. I think for very large, influential media organizations, it is a service to the readership to have someone in that role. I see it as unfortunate, but not a tragedy, that these roles have been discontinued. What have you made of the pushes in newsrooms to have better representation of previously marginalized voices, as well as to rethink journalistic objectivity? It's extremely important to have real diversity, not tokenism, in newsrooms. You get different important perspectives and internal criticism and points of view when you have a diverse population in the newsroom -- at the top levels, too. I was proud at The Buffalo News to name the first person of color, a Black man, Rod Watson, to newsroom management. I was also very proud to name a woman, Lisa Wilson, as our executive sports editor. She was one of only a few women sports editors in the country, not to mention a Black woman.

Economy,Why Unemployment Claims May Be Overcounted by Millions,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/business/economy/unemployment-claims-numbers.html,"Economic statistics were never designed to measure the sudden shutdown and restart of large segments of the U.S. economy. Still, if there is one question that the government seemingly should be able to answer, it is this: How many Americans are receiving unemployment benefits? Since the start of the pandemic, however, federal data on the unemployment insurance system has been plagued by errors, double counting and other issues. And even after the initial flood of layoffs slowed, the problems have only grown in recent weeks, in part because of an apparent spike in fraudulent claims for benefits. The biggest problems appear to involve Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a program created by Congress in March to cover freelancers, self-employed workers and others who are left out of the regular unemployment system. Federal data implies that nearly 15 million Americans are now receiving benefits under the program, but some economists believe that overstates the true number by millions. The scale of the overcounting issue varies by state. In Texas, figures for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims closely match the federal government's. But in Montana, the state says just 9,000 people are receiving benefits under the program, versus the more than 60,000 reported by the federal government.

The biggest problems, at least in absolute numbers, are in California. The federal data suggests that nearly seven million Californians are receiving pandemic benefits. The state's data shows that number is under two million. The counting issues don't change the broad contours of the crisis: By any measure, millions of Americans are relying on unemployment benefits to buy groceries and pay rent. But they do make it harder to answer basic questions about how quickly the economy is improving and how successful government programs have been at mitigating the damage. ""This does really underscore just how important it is that we make key investments in our data infrastructure, because now we know what it feels like when we don't have good data,"" said Heidi Shierholz, director of policy for the Economic Policy Institute. The complex unemployment system makes it hard to get a national picture. The United States doesn't have an unemployment insurance system. It has 53 systems, one for each state plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Each operates independently, with its own rules and procedures, subject to policies set at the federal level. State unemployment offices report data to the U.S. Labor Department, which compiles the numbers into a weekly report. One number in that report, known as ""continuing claims,"" counts filings of people who have previously filed for benefits and have remained unemployed since the previous week.

That figure is often treated by economists as an estimate of the number of people receiving unemployment benefits. But that isn't actually what it measures, at least not directly. It counts applications, not all of which are approved. And rather than counting the number of individuals applying for benefits, it counts the total number of weeks of benefits they apply for. That distinction doesn't matter much in normal times, when most people apply for benefits on a weekly basis and are quickly approved. But because benefits are paid retroactively, if there are delays processing applications, people can end up applying for multiple weeks of benefits at once, skewing the continuing-claims number. That seems to be a particular issue in California, according to a new analysis of state unemployment data by researchers at the California Policy Lab. Some of the recent flood of applications for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance there are from people saying they lost jobs in the early weeks of the pandemic, meaning they could be owed months' worth of benefits, said Till von Wachter, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was an author of the Policy Lab analysis. State officials say many backdated claims in that new flood may be fraudulent. But others may not be, Mr. von Wachter said. Someone in the film industry, for example, might not have applied for benefits right away last spring, on the assumption that business would bounce back relatively quickly. But now, with no reopening in sight, the worker might decide to file -- and to claim, legitimately, to have been out of work since April. Weekly unemployment reports are a timely but flawed measure of the economy.

Weekly unemployment filings were not intended to be an economic indicator. They aren't collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Labor Department agency that produces the unemployment rate and related measures, and they aren't subject to the quality controls applied to official statistics.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Instead, the data is collected by the states and reported to the Employment and Training Administration, a Labor Department agency charged with overseeing the states' unemployment systems. Asked about the data discrepancies, the department said the numbers were intended primarily for administrative purposes, like allocating federal funding for state employment agencies.

Economists pay attention to unemployment filings because they're often an early-warning system for trouble in the labor market. But once the alarm has been sounded, economists usually turn to more reliable monthly and quarterly data to get a more complete picture of what is going on. The speed of the present crisis has put a premium on timely data. At the same time, state unemployment systems, many of which run on decades-old software, were overwhelmed by the flood of applications for traditional unemployment benefits, while carrying out a new program that covered a separate category of workers. That made it hard for them to report accurate data. ""It's a fast number, but that doesn't make it a good number,"" said Eliza Forsythe, a University of Illinois economist who studies unemployment. Data on the pandemic assistance program has been especially confusing. The standard unemployment system leaves out a lot of people: freelancers, self-employed workers and people with too little work history to qualify. (That can include some low-paid part-time and low-wage workers.) The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program is meant to fill that gap. By many measures, the program has been a success, helping millions of workers who would otherwise have had no source of income. But data on the program has been troubled from the start. Many states took weeks to get the program up and running, and when they did, many did not begin reporting data right away. Once the data started coming in, it was often hard to interpret -- some states would report thousands of recipients one week, then zero the next. Processing backlogs made it hard to separate recent job losses from layoffs that happened early in the pandemic. ""The claims that are coming in are borderline nonsensical sometimes,"" said Kathryn Anne Edwards, an economist at RAND who studies the unemployment system.

""It's both an overcount and an undercount at the same time,"" Ms. Forsythe said. The good news is that there is little evidence that the recent increase in unemployment claims, particularly in the pandemic program, reflects a real-world increase in the rate of job losses. While layoffs are continuing, most public and private data sources show a gradual improvement in the labor market. But those same sources suggest that progress has slowed in recent weeks, and that the absolute level of joblessness remains high.",Weekly tallies of jobless claims were not meant to be treated as an economic indicator.

Art & Design,12 Galleries to Visit Now in Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/arts/design/art-galleries-to-see-in-chelsea-right-now.html,"Chelsea may be the New York art neighborhood that many people love to disdain. It also may be approaching a tipping point, where new apartment towers outnumber galleries. But the place is not monolithic. Its scores of galleries come in all shapes, sizes and annual budgets, and as usual they offer a ton of art to be seen. Here is but a small sample. THE KITCHEN through May 12; 512 West 19th Street, thekitchen.org. Chelsea's busiest, most multimedia alternative space is presenting the outstanding ""Charles Atlas: the past is here, the futures are coming."" It reviews the long, often brilliant career of Mr. Atlas, who has few equals when it comes to blurring the lines among art, documentary, dance and film. Eight video collaborations made from 1982 to 2016 with different choreographers dazzle with their different camerawork and editing -- especially those created with Michael Clark and Yvonne Rainer. The centerpiece is ""2003,"" an enormous five-channel-video montage of Mr. Atlas's dance films and various interviews and current events, like the Iraq war. The totality equals a crash course in New York choreographic history that reveals an ingenious symbiosis of dance and film. MICHAEL ROSENFELD GALLERY through June 2; 100 11th Avenue, michaelrosenfeldart.com. Claire Falkenstein (1908-1997), who, outside her native California, has never had a full-scale retrospective in this country, is generally known for her exquisitely excessive sculptures dating from the mid-1950s -- welded metal tangles embedded with bright pieces of Venetian glass. ""Claire Falkenstein: Matter in Motion"" explodes this narrow view with nearly 50 works, introducing a relentless exploration of abstraction in early paintings on canvas and also curved perforated aluminum; sculptures of wood and glazed ceramics; and one fantastic mixed-media relief. Her dialogue with artists like David Smith and Jackson Pollock is but one fascination. More rewriting of art history, please.

GARTH GREENAN through May 19; 545 West 20th Street, garthgreenan.com. Jaune Quick-to-See Smith's robust combination of the painterly, the political and much else has only gotten stronger, especially in the Trade Canoe series dating to the early 1990s. Three additions to it dominate her first show in New York since 2013. In them the big canoes are piled with symbols of conflict between American Indians and settlers, including skulls, schematic buffalo heads (which conjure arrowheads), the names of extinct animals and other texts, and portraits of Geronimo and George Armstrong Custer. Denser is better, as in ""Trade Canoe: Ghost Canoe,"" but everything exudes multiple passions: for art history, color, oil paint, endangered cultures and setting the record straight.

303 GALLERY through May 25; 555 West 21st Street, 303gallery.com. Doug Aitken has stepped back from the large video spectacles for which he is known to make a small one, ""New Era."" It occupies a hexagonal space that alternates wall-size mirrors and video screens, often to great kaleidoscopic effect. It centers on Martin Cooper, now 89, who as an engineer at Motorola invented the mobile phone and on April 3, 1973, placed the first mobile-phone call, from a street in Manhattan. His voice-over proceeds from an initial optimism that the world might become one, to observations about aging and technology that seem more like a lament. Mr. Aitken's camera takes in vast stretches of barren terrain and highway cloverleafs. He also manipulates images of the original phone's keypad, creating patterns resembling housing developments that turn deliriously hallucinatory. In keeping with Mr. Cooper's darkening view, there is a prevailing sense of isolation and anonymity, alternating with breathtaking beauty, especially of the earth itself.

JACK SHAINMAN GALLERY through May 12; 513 West 20th Street and 524 West 24th Street, jackshainman.com. Hank Willis Thomas's art always hits its mark, but the question is, does he aim high enough? ""What We Ask Is Simple,"" his especially ambitious show suggests a steeper angle. Seen in dimmed lighting, it occupies the gallery's two spaces, and its most plentiful works are wall pieces on glass that lead double lives. Initially they look mostly blank -- some have textures suggesting abstract painting, others have fragments of figures. Shine a cellphone flashlight on one or flash-photograph it, and crowded, sometimes violent vintage photographs appear. They show various civil rights protests -- Birmingham and St. Augustine (anti-segregation), London (women's suffrage), Nuremberg in 1933 (anti-Nazi). The shock is magical yet emotionally unsettling, reminding you of people's courage in the face of oppression, history's erasures, and the way the past recedes into darkness. The problem is that the images and the history they preserve gets a little lost in the brilliant, if slightly gimmicky, technique.

ANDREW KREPS through May 12; 537 West 22nd Street, andrewkreps.com. Here, the German photographer Annette Kelm and the maverick Darren Bader have side-by-side shows. In ""Knots,"" Ms. Kelm continues to fuse advertising, Conceptual Art and Surrealism using odd juxtapositions and gorgeous colors. The show is a bit uneven; the best works put flowers or plants in strange company. In ""E/either e/Either n/Neither N/neither,"" Mr. Bader has mounted a small three-ring circus that centers on language, using books, soap, his father's piano and his own poetry, which is printed on green crime-scene tape that has been strewn about the floor and Lawrence Weiner-style graphics splayed across the walls. As is usual with Mr. Bader, the general effect is obscure, irreverent and looks good.

CHEIM & READ through May 12; 547 West 25th Street, cheimread.com. A few years ago, Ghada Amer, long known for translating images of women from pornographic magazines into embroidery on canvas, started applying these motifs to glazed clay. The dripping glaze affords her subjects a bit of privacy, like the dangling thread in the canvas pieces. The contrast between the two mediums here suggests that clay currently serves Ms. Amer better. She connects with its materiality and the images -- appearing on free-standing sheets of curving wall pieces -- are less photographic than before. This excellent development should encourage Ms. Amer to expand her imagery too. FLAG FOUNDATION through May 19; 545 West 25th Street, ninth floor, flagartfoundation.org. Here you'll find two thoughtfully dovetailed shows that span generations. ""Painting/Object"" presents the work of five young artists who work in and around painting in very physical ways: Sarah Crowner, Sam Moyer, Julia Rommel, N. Dash and Erin Shirreff (who also has a multimedia solo show at Sikkema Jenkins & Co. on 22nd Street through May 19). They variously use sewing, stone, adobe, hemp and photography. Downstairs, an important precedent is honored in ""Ellsworth Kelly: Black and White Works,"" organized by Jack Shear, husband of the artist, who died in 2015. Kelly's affection for black and white is well known, but Mr. Shear spins it afresh across photography, drawing, sculpture and especially Kelly's relief-like paintings. ""Gate-Board,"" a combination of white board and black string from 1950 is, alone, worth the elevator ride.

PACE GALLERY through May 12; 510 West 25th Street, pacegallery.com. Unlike David Hockney's crystalline retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, this show is an energetic messy update in which he pursues his new reverse perspective paintings glimpsed at the Met, partly by eliminating the bottom corners of the canvases. This tips some familiar motifs -- the Grand Canyon, the hills of Yorkshire and Malibu, his blue terrace -- toward the viewer as on a tilted plate. The reversal is clearest in ""Still Life"" and ""Walk Around the Hotel Actalan"" and diagramed in ""Moving Focus."" What's great about Mr. Hockney is the way he makes his ideas about painting so pictorially accessible. Two mural-size photographic drawings of the artist in his studio surrounded by many of the show's paintings offer further delights in perspective.","A sampling of the visual riches available this weekend in Chelsea, the most disdained of New York's gallery neighborhoods.",78172855-e968-5019-8818-f9665eb46822,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/27/arts/27guide-chelsea5/27guide-chelsea5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=d95b9bbdd43efd56036e60b30e3131ebe2ef4fdd2a8be95a65e325cbe0c3a863&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A detail of &ldquo;Inside It Opens Up as Well,&rdquo; at Mr. Hockney&rsquo;s show at Pace Gallery.",78172855-e968-5019-8818-f9665eb46822,Demo_data/D1_imgs/178172855-e968-5019-8818-f9665eb46822.jpg,14,14
Science,Perseid Meteor Shower: Watch It Peak in Night Skies,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/science/perseid-meteor-shower.html,"[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]

Where meteor showers come from

If you spot a meteor shower, what you're usually seeing is an icy comet's leftovers that crash into Earth's atmosphere. Comets are sort of like dirty snowballs: As they travel through the solar system, they leave behind a dusty trail of rocks and ice that lingers in space long after they leave. When Earth passes through these cascades of comet waste, the bits of debris -- which can be as small as grains of sand -- pierce the sky at such speeds that they burst, creating a celestial fireworks display.

A general rule of thumb with meteor showers: You are never watching the Earth cross into remnants from a comet's most recent orbit. Instead, the burning bits come from the previous passes. For example, during the Perseid meteor shower you are seeing meteors ejected from when its parent comet, Comet Swift-Tuttle, visited in 1862 or earlier, not from its most recent pass in 1992.

That's because it takes time for debris from a comet's orbit to drift into a position where it intersects with Earth's orbit, according to Bill Cooke, an astronomer with NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office.

The best way to see a meteor shower is to get to a location that has a clear view of the entire night sky. Ideally, that would be somewhere with dark skies, away from city lights and traffic. To maximize your chances of catching the show, look for a spot that offers a wide, unobstructed view.

Bits and pieces of meteor showers are visible for a certain period of time, but they really peak visibly from dusk to dawn on a given few days. Those days are when Earth's orbit crosses through the thickest part of the cosmic stream. Meteor showers can vary in their peak times, with some reaching their maximums for only a few hours and others for several nights. The showers tend to be most visible after midnight and before dawn.","Meteor showers can light up night skies from dusk to dawn, and if you're lucky you might be able to catch a glimpse.",a9648613-d62f-57a4-a7e5-71e05440f53e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/18/science/space-calendar-perseids/space-calendar-perseids-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=eabd43bc567609c58c24478a38f8dab800a425c6be91a013dfe3622e7c7ab085&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A meteor visible during a Perseid meteor shower in Spruce Knob, W.Va.",a9648613-d62f-57a4-a7e5-71e05440f53e,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1a9648613-d62f-57a4-a7e5-71e05440f53e.jpg,2,20
Education,Private Schools in Suburbs Tap Manhattan Market,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/education/22westchester.html,"Finally, Manhattan parents can apply to a private school this fall that does not require their 4-year-olds to undergo intelligence testing or solicit donations for the building fund. Tuition is $20,000 annually, half the cost of some other private schools. The catch: This school is in Westchester County. Mohawk Country Day School, in White Plains, will begin busing in Manhattan students next fall. The small school, which has preschool, kindergarten and first-grade classes totaling 150 students, hopes to expand its base among New York City families who have long sent their children to its 40-acre site in the summer for the Mohawk Day Camp. ""The ride from Upper Manhattan is 30 to 35 minutes,"" said Barbara Schainman, whose family has directed the school and camp for more than 40 years. ""Parents who have enjoyed the summer experience -- and whose children have enjoyed the bus ride -- say, 'Why can't we do this year-round?' "" Confronted with fierce competition for Manhattan's top private schools and overcrowding and wait lists at many public schools, some city parents are seeking out suburban schools that typically offer lower tuitions and easier admissions, as well as multiple playing fields and even nature preserves.

""It has always been difficult getting into kindergarten, but what's changed is the amount of hassle,"" said Emily Glickman, the president of Abacus Guide Educational Consulting. ""Now test prep is de rigueur, and you're applying to more schools. ""You don't even have your neighborhood school as a backup because of waiting lists."" For those seeking an alternative, the Hackley School in Tarrytown will dispatch buses to the Upper East and Upper West Sides for the first time next fall to carry students back to its Westchester campus. And just over the George Washington Bridge in New Jersey, the Dwight-Englewood School will expand its efforts to recruit city students by offering door-to-door pickup for children in preschool through fifth grade. Dwight-Englewood's head of school, Rodney V. De Jarnett, said city parents told him one of the draws of crossing the river was that ""the elbows over here are not quite as sharp."" While the school does require E.R.B. testing for admission, it accepts 45 percent of applicants, compared with, for example, 8.2 percent at the Trinity School on the Upper West Side. At Dwight-Englewood, there are 50 New York City students, including three kindergartners, enrolled this year, up from two in 2005. ""I really feel for Manhattan parents,"" Dr. De Jarnett said. ""The pressure to get their children into school is not what we feel here.""

So they hurried to apply to private schools -- some were no longer handing out applications -- and Zachary was eventually admitted to one, the Birch Wathen Lenox School, a few blocks from their home. While they have been pleased with Birch, Mrs. Gollub said she also loved Mohawk's open space and hands-on learning. ""We have a science room in the city, but here you actually get to go outside and see it and touch it,"" she said while visiting Mohawk last week. ""By having this option, you get to stay in the city and have that suburbia feeling."" At Mohawk, children count by picking concord grapes off the vine and test their math skills with a recipe for grape jelly. They learn firsthand about nature by feeding lambs and goats or releasing butterflies in a garden. Ms. Schainman said classes typically had no more than 16 students, with two teachers, and could expand to higher grades in coming years. Mohawk is renovating a building to add classes for the city students and will register them on a first-come basis beginning this month. At Dwight-Englewood, the $30,000 tuition provides entree to a 45-acre campus that includes a nature preserve with deer and wild turkeys and gardens where students plant tomatoes and herbs. Ben Feldberg, who in 2005 became one of the school's first Manhattan students, said he traded in a three-minute walk to the Dalton School for a 20-minute bus ride after being smitten with the grassy fields and more laid-back atmosphere. ""It was less focused on getting into college and more focused on you as a student,"" he said. His parents, Michael Feldberg and Ruth Lazarus, have hosted receptions at their Upper East Side home to help recruit other New York families. Hackley alumni in Manhattan also pushed for their alma mater to start running buses to the city so their children could commute, said Walter Johnson, the headmaster. Currently, fewer than 5 percent of Hackley's 840 students come from the city. ""The logistics of getting from Manhattan to Hackley may seem daunting to parents,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""But in fact, Hackley is under 25 miles from West or East 96th Streets, or a 40-minute bus trip, quicker than getting across town.""

Mr. Johnson said the school, which typically accepts one in four applicants, decided it would benefit from having a wider applicant pool and stronger ties with its city alumni, some of whom go to the campus to speak and provide internships for students. Paul Sohn, a Hackley graduate and hedge fund manager who lives in TriBeCa, said he would consider Hackley for his 14-month-old daughter. ""It's a great school, a high-quality education, lots of open space and fresh air,"" he said. ""I just had a great experience there. It's nice that I now have this option without having to move to Westchester."" Even city parents who thought they would never consider suburban schools now are. Allison Chayut, an Upper West Side mother, said she discovered Mohawk after her twins, Jack and Ty, were wait-listed at Nos. 40 and 41 for their neighborhood school, Public School 199. As she called weekly to check if they had moved up the wait list, she started picturing her boys at Mohawk. The boys were admitted to P.S. 199 in the third week of August, but Ms. Chayut is now telling other parents about Mohawk. ""This was a definite Plan B for us, even though I wasn't crazy about driving there,"" she said. ""If we didn't get into 199, we were going into Mohawk.""","Private schools in Westchester County and New Jersey are less expensive and less competitive in admissions, and some will soon offer buses to and from New York City.",fbb17ede-194d-5fb9-a31b-ee2e8d4739f9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/22/nyregion/WESTCHESTER/WESTCHESTER-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=315&w=600&s=a1afb70bae59dc00e1f7c0d1ff841d4486dc5f728b61508832b528ab4e7fef4a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Mohawk Country Day School, in White Plains, will begin busing students in from New York, hoping to sway parents who send their children to a summer camp there.",fbb17ede-194d-5fb9-a31b-ee2e8d4739f9,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1fbb17ede-194d-5fb9-a31b-ee2e8d4739f9.jpg,22,7
Health,"Africa and Pakistan Face Polio Outbreaks, in Blow to Global Fight",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/23/health/polio-outbreaks-seen-on-two-continents.html,"The global effort to eradicate polio, a disease that has been on the brink of extinction for years, is facing serious setbacks on two continents. The virus is surging in Somalia and the Horn of Africa, which had been largely free of cases for several years. And a new outbreak has begun in a part of Pakistan that a warlord declared off limits to vaccinators 14 months ago. The African outbreak began in May with just two cases of polio paralysis: one in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, and another in the huge Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya, where thousands of Somalis have fled fighting between Islamic militants, clan militias, government troops and African peacekeepers. Now there are 121 cases in the region; last year, there were only 223 in the world. The new Pakistan outbreak is in North Waziristan, near the frontier with Afghanistan. It is in an area where a warlord banned polio vaccinations after it was disclosed that the C.I.A. had staged a hepatitis vaccination campaign in its hunt for Osama bin Laden. The warlord, Hafiz Gul Bahadur, banned all efforts until American drone strikes ended. Although only three North Waziristan children have suffered polio paralysis since then, even one case shows that the virus is in the area and could spread.

The new outbreaks may delay a recently announced $5.5 billion plan to eradicate polio by 2018. Nonetheless, public health officials still believe that, with enough local political will and donor money, they can prevail by using techniques that have worked before. To prevent the disease from reaching Mecca during next month's hajj, Saudi Arabia has tightened its rules. Pilgrims from any country with polio cases must be vaccinated at home and again on arrival. Last year, nearly 500,000 pilgrims were vaccinated on arrival, Dr. Ziad A. Memish, the Saudi deputy health minister, said recently. The Pakistan outbreak is particularly frustrating because eradication had been going steadily forward despite the killings in December of nine vaccinators for which some blamed the Taliban. Public health officials had counted themselves lucky that despite simultaneous vaccination bans in North and South Waziristan, no polio virus was known to be circulating in the 250,000 children in those areas. Vaccination posts were set up on nearby highways and on buses and trains. Urban hospitals packed the vaccine on ice for families willing to smuggle it back to neighbors. But it was not enough. ""The equation is simple,"" said Dr. Elias Durry, emergency coordinator for polio eradication in Pakistan for the World Health Organization. ""Where you can immunize, the virus goes away. Where you can't, the virus gets in, and it will paralyze these poor kids.""

Dr. Durry said he hoped that parents whose children were paralyzed would speak up at local decision-making councils, called shuras, that are common in tribal areas, and possibly put pressure on warlords to rescind the ban. The Taliban warlord in South Waziristan, Maulvi Nazir, was killed by a drone strike in January. Before the Waziristan outbreak, Pakistan had seen only 24 cases this year, about as many as it had at the same point in 2012. Most were around Karachi and Peshawar, where last year's killings of the vaccinators took place and where resistance to vaccines is highest. The Somali outbreak is different. There is little opposition to the vaccine itself, said Dr. Bruce Aylward, the W.H.O. assistant director general for polio. In several Muslim countries, including Pakistan, the drive has been hurt by rumors that the vaccine sterilizes girls or contains the virus that causes AIDS or pork products. But, he said, many cases are in areas south of Mogadishu where the Shabab, a militant group, operate. The group opposes mass campaigns because it believes the sight of thousands of vaccinators going house to house would undercut its claim to rule those areas. ""It's all about control,"" Dr. Aylward said. Instead, the campaign negotiates with local chiefs and midlevel Shabab members to hold small drives. Other tactics have changed, too: children of any age, and sometimes adults, get the drops, and drives are held twice a month instead of every three months. Refugee camps face other obstacles. Large ones often have lawless areas on their fringes where vaccinators may fear to work because of predatory criminals.

""When this started, I said, 'Brace yourself for hundreds of cases,' "" Dr. Aylward said, because he knew that few children born in the last five years had been immunized. Still, he said he believed this outbreak could be beaten because it echoed the one that plagued the region from 2005 to 2007. It also began in Mogadishu, and it spread as far as Yemen and Eritrea and paralyzed about 700 children before multiple mass vaccination rounds snuffed it out. Kenya, Yemen and Ethiopia are already planning those with help from Geneva. Somalia is so dangerous for health workers that Doctors Without Borders pulled out of the country this month after 22 years there. But polio officials hope their campaign will not be targeted, largely because it creates thousands of temporary paying jobs for ""volunteer"" vaccinators. In Mogadishu in July, President Hassan Sheik Mohamud publicly took polio drops at an event encouraging parents to vaccinate. Asha Ali, 38, a mother of four, changed her attitude. ""I was thinking the vaccine might sicken our children,"" she said. ""I realized later that it was good."" Hamdi Hashi, 26, said she accepted it ""because I don't want this serious disease to cripple my children."" But Habow Madey, in a different Mogadishu neighborhood, said her husband had forbidden vaccination, believing it causes ""a mysterious disease.""","The virus is surging in Somalia and the Horn of Africa, and a new outbreak has begun in a part of Pakistan that a warlord declared off limits to vaccinators 14 months ago.",64774544-1df5-57d0-b085-5f1a64544a09,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/23/health/23polio2/23polio2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=7105975cebbfc7da74eb88625ca624d0e3a1a9610ba5c69c70ce65a4c0a55097&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,A Pakistani child received a polio vaccine in a railway station in Karachi.,64774544-1df5-57d0-b085-5f1a64544a09,Demo_data/D1_imgs/164774544-1df5-57d0-b085-5f1a64544a09.jpg,1,20
Science,"Climate Change Is Altering Lakes and Streams, Study Suggests",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/science/climate-change-lakes-streams.html,"To scientists who study lakes and rivers, it seems humans have embarked on a huge unplanned experiment. By burning fossil fuels, we have already raised the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 40 percent, and we're on track to increase it by much more. Some of that gas may mix into the world's inland waters, and recent studies hint that this may have profound effects on the species that live in them. ""We're monkeying with the very chemical foundation of these ecosystems,"" said Emily H. Stanley, a limnologist (freshwater ecologist) at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison. ""But right now we don't know enough yet to know where we're going. To me, scientifically that's really interesting, and as a human a little bit frightening."" Scientists began taking continuous measurements of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the 1950s, and today they have more than six decades of consistent readings. In the 1980s, oceanographers followed suit, developing carbon dioxide sensors and deploying them across the planet.

Over the past three decades, they've chronicled a steady rise of carbon dioxide in seawater. The increasing concentration can harm marine life in many ways. It lowers the pH of seawater, for one thing, making it more acidic and interfering with the chemistry that coral, for instance, use to build their calcium skeletons. Ocean acidification also thins the shells of oysters and other animals. Many marine organisms rely on chemical changes in water to find food and avoid danger. ""Many fish are not able to detect their predators anymore,"" said Linda C. Weiss, an aquatic ecologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. ""They can even get more bold."" Dr. Weiss first came to appreciate the impact of ocean acidification in 2010, when she spent time at a marine research station in Australia. The experience left her wondering if lakes and rivers might face a similar threat. Her first step was to look for historical data about carbon dioxide levels in fresh water. But a literature search brought her to a surprising conclusion. ""I discovered there was no information,"" she said.

Traditionally, scientists who have studied inland waters have focused on different questions. They've been more concerned, for example, with sulfuric acid and other pollutants in acid rain, along with the impacts of runoff from farms and yards. Now that researchers have grown concerned about carbon dioxide levels, they've been developing ways to reconstruct their history. The level of carbon dioxide in a lake depends on such variables as its temperature and how much organic carbon it contains. If those factors have been tracked in the past, scientists can use them to get an estimate of a lake's carbon dioxide level, too. Dr. Weiss and her colleagues used this method to figure out the carbon dioxide levels in four reservoirs in Germany from 1981 to 2015. They reported Thursday in the journal Current Biology that the amounts tripled in that time. ""We didn't really know what to expect,"" said Dr. Weiss. ""But the speed of acidification we find is quite fast."" The researchers wondered what effects this fast rise in carbon dioxide might have on freshwater life in decades to come. So they ran experiments on the humble water flea.

Water fleas use a bizarre but sophisticated defense to escape predators. They can sense chemicals given off by fish in their vicinity, and in response they make themselves harder to eat. Some species grow a massive crest on their head, while others sprout spikes. Dr. Weiss and her colleagues found that high levels of carbon dioxide caused water fleas to make smaller crests and shorter spikes. Rather than the acidity of the water, carbon dioxide itself seems to be affecting the water fleas. When the researchers lowered the pH with hydrochloric acid, the water fleas responded normally to predators. Dr. Weiss hypothesized that carbon dioxide interferes with the nervous system of the water fleas, blunting their ability to look out for predators. Caleb T. Hasler, a biologist at the University of Winnipeg, said that the new research addressed an unanswered question: the amounts of carbon dioxide that might harm freshwater life. ""This paper is really important because it starts to show where those levels might be,"" he said. Dr. Hasler's own recent research hints that water fleas may not be the only freshwater animals to be altered by carbon dioxide. He and his colleagues studied minnows swimming in water rich with carbon dioxide and found that the fish don't respond as quickly to alarm signals released by other minnows.

In another study, the team studied two species of mussels. One species relaxed its muscles in water high in carbon dioxide, so that its shell gaped open. The other species clamped its shell shut, so that it could no longer filter food. These sorts of changes may send ripples out across entire freshwater ecosystems. Mussels are vital for filtering food and keeping water clear, for example. If water fleas do a worse job of escaping predators, their population may decline, leaving less food in the long run for fish. But it's not certain that inland waters around the world are building up carbon dioxide at the rate that Dr. Weiss and her colleagues observed in the German reservoirs. In November, Dr. Stanley and her colleagues published a study of carbon dioxide levels in lakes in Wisconsin. Between 1986 and 2011, they detected no significant change at all. The mismatch points to the complex chemistry varying from one lake to the next. While lakes and rivers all absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, some also draw in the gas from surrounding soils. The chemistry of some inland waters causes a lot of carbon dioxide to be converted into other compounds. Some lakes and streams may support a lot of underwater plants that take up the gas, for instance, while others may have microbes can release more of it. Making matters even more complicated, the carbon dioxide levels in any particular body of freshwater can change drastically over time with swings in temperature and other conditions.","Like the ocean, fresh water absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. But the effects are likely to vary widely from place to place.",fa7fcff9-77d8-550f-a56d-9aeadd92d16f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/16/science/16SCI-ZIMMER1/16SCI-ZIMMER1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=17f460f3ee35d9d3640a5b30106325a1f09429b86c5e509622fe5bde6039ae7f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Sorpe reservoir in northwest Germany, one of four freshwater reservoirs observed in a recent study that found that carbon dioxide absorbed in lakes, rivers and streams can affect entire ecosystems.",fa7fcff9-77d8-550f-a56d-9aeadd92d16f,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1fa7fcff9-77d8-550f-a56d-9aeadd92d16f.jpg,2,20
Music,"The Afrobeats Star Davido, an Upbeat Voice in a Turbulent Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/arts/music/davido-a-better-time.html,"Davido -- the American-born Nigerian Afrobeats artist David Adedeji Adeleke -- has built an international career on songs about love and lust that have collectively amassed more than a billion streams. The album he is releasing on Friday, ""A Better Time,"" is filled with them. But the perky song that opens the LP, ""Fem"" (""Shut Up""), has taken on an unexpected role since it appeared in September: as a protest song for Nigerians demonstrating to end police brutality and corruption. ""It was on an entirely different subject,"" Davido, 27, said via a shaky video connection from his home in Lagos, with his fiancee, Chioma Rowland, and their 1-year-old son, Ifeanyi, nearby. ""What the song is literally saying is to tell somebody that talks too much to shut up.""

The protests were set off by anger at a notorious police unit, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, and became known as the #EndSARS movement. On Oct. 11, Davido joined protests in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, and ended up defusing a confrontation between the police and demonstrators; videos of the incident raced across social media. He had come for a meeting with the inspector general of police, Mohammed Adumu, initially hoping to bring along fellow artists. He also had a livestreamed meeting with Nigeria's speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila. ""They kept on saying, 'Yeah, but give us time, give us time,'"" Davido recalled. ""But it's like, yo, we've given you time. You have to understand people have been fighting this system since 1960. It's long overdue. And it doesn't even end with SARS. EndSARS is one of a million problems.""

Yet Burna Boy has often incorporated historical and sociopolitical messages in his songs. Davido, instead, has concentrated on more lighthearted topics: romance, ambition and positive thinking. One of his first big hits in Nigeria, ""Dami Duro"" from 2011, declares, ""You can't stop me""; it was his reaction, he told the website Bella Naija, to being picked up by the police on his way to the studio. ""One thing about Africans -- rich or poor, happy or sad, no matter the situation going on in your culture, you always find time to smile and just be happy,"" Davido said. ""People always like to celebrate. So on this album, there's no downers. It's just straight bangers and music to make people happy."" Nigerian Afrobeats was poised for its American breakthrough in 2020. The music is a gleaming, transparent, ultramodern reclamation of a broad African diaspora -- American and Afro-Caribbean styles as well as music from all around Africa -- programmed by some of the world's most creative producers and songwriters. Like hip-hop, Afrobeats revels in collaborations and crossovers. Tiwa Savage, who sings a duet with Davido for ""Tanana,"" on the new album (after his appearance on her 2020 album, ""Celia""), said in a video interview that Afrobeats is ""a new genre and still growing. I think we all realize that we need to work together. We've all realized that it can't be just one person. We all have to come as a force.""

American album releases, concert tours and festival dates were booked for Afrobeats stars in 2020. Then the pandemic hit and plans collapsed. Davido had to cancel a sold-out, 26-show American tour soon after it began -- but it only made him more prolific. He returned to Lagos and brought a revolving cast of producers to his home studio, working at all hours. ""I definitely like to be there for the whole process, from the beat, to the engineering, to the arrangements, to the mixing, to the mastering -- everything,"" he said. In a few months, they churned out more than three dozen songs; 17 appear on ""A Better Time."" Davido said, ""I just kept on recording. I had nothing else to do."" Davido was born in Atlanta but grew up in Lagos; his father, Adedeji T. Adeleke, is one of Nigeria's wealthiest businessmen, the founder and C.E.O. of the conglomerate Pacific Holdings Ltd. ""I'm from both sides of the world,"" he said. ""I'm from Nigeria and at the same time I'm from America. And it's like both sides are going crazy right now."" After attending the British International School in Lagos, he returned to America to study business administration at Oakwood University in Huntsville, Ala. But he was more interested in music, and he got the equipment to start producing his own beats. While in the United States, he also soaked up hip-hop's entrepreneurial spirit. ""I wouldn't say my time in the States affects my African music,"" he said. ""But my style, the way I dress, my attitude, my charisma, the way I run my label -- I think I get a lot of that from studying the American system and people like 50 Cent.""

Against his parents' wishes, Davido left college and moved to London and then to Lagos to make music, determined to prove he was not merely some wealthy dilettante. He released his first album, ""Omo Baba Olowo"" (""Son of a Rich Man""), in 2012, when he was 19. He had hit after hit in Nigeria, and he drew collaborators from Africa and then beyond: Meek Mill and Rae Sremmurd on non-album singles, Tinashe on his 2016 EP ""Son of Mercy,"" Chris Brown and the Jamaican hitmaker Popcaan on his 2019 album ""A Good Time."" Meanwhile his tour venues kept getting larger; in 2019, he headlined the 20,000-capacity O2 Arena in London. While his international audience expanded, Davido found himself singing more, not fewer, lyrics in Yoruba rather than English. ""Back in the day, I'd say everybody really had the mind-set that, 'Oh, the more English you sing, the more they understand you,'"" he said. ""But my biggest records in America are records where I've spoken my dialect."" The new album includes a twinkling affirmation of deep affection, ""Very Special""; the breezily suspicious ""Something Fishy""; a touch of 1990s hip-hop with appearances from Nas and Hit-Boy on ""Birthday Cake""; and ""So Crazy,"" a midtempo duet with the Atlanta rapper Lil Baby that seesaws between heartbreak and come-on. Davido also has African collaborators, including the Kenyan band Sauti Sol, the South African rapper and singer Sho Madjozi and the Nigerian singer and producer CKay. Davido secured a collaboration with Nicki Minaj, ""Holy Ground,"" when, drunk after a night at a club, he sent her a direct message on Instagram, where she follows him. ""I'm like, 'Hello, Nicki, I'm a big fan. I got a hit for us.' She says, 'Send it.' I'm like, what? And then I send it. And two days later she sent it back. That's exactly what happened: no label in between, no mutual friend, nothing like that. It was just plain magic."" Despite his excitement about the new work, the pandemic has left Davido, like countless other musicians, frustrated about what comes next. ""I'm not even sure if I'm going to be able to perform in the near future -- and I've got all these banging records,"" he said. ""It's taking a toll on me.""",The 27-year-old musician focuses on lighthearted topics. But one of his latest songs has become an anthem of resistance.,03714829-40f7-5ac2-be78-50a14d64c2b0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/11/arts/11davido1/11davido1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=2bc529f6d4a1ba5ff58597d21b7aa668fec55478fa54c579049a435bb1a717f7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Fem,"" the song that opens Davido's new album, ""A Better Time,"" has become a protest song for Nigerians demonstrating against police brutality.",03714829-40f7-5ac2-be78-50a14d64c2b0,Demo_data/D1_imgs/103714829-40f7-5ac2-be78-50a14d64c2b0.jpg,12,20
Food,"Black Vegans Step Out, for Their Health and Other Causes",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/dining/black-vegan-cooking.html,"Black Vegans Step Out, for Their Health and Other Causes

Aph Ko got tired of hearing that eating vegan was something only white people did. So in 2015, she created a list of 100 black vegans for a website. It included pioneering figures like Dick Gregory and Coretta Scott King and younger, less famous writers, filmmakers, cooks and activists. ""When you say 'vegan,' a lot of people tend to only think of PETA, which doesn't reflect the massive landscape of vegan activism,"" said Ms. Ko, 28, a Floridian whose favorite dish at the moment is the spinach pie in ""The Vegan Stoner Cookbook."" ""The black vegan movement is one of the most diverse, decolonial, complex and creative movements."" So many other people wanted to be included on the list after it appeared, she started a website, Black Vegans Rock. That spawned a Twitter hashtag (#blackvegansrock) and a T-shirt business. In June, she published ""Aphro-ism: Essays on Pop Culture, Feminism, and Black Veganism from Two Sisters,"" a book she wrote with her older sister, Syl Ko. Vegan cooking and eating are having a renaissance among black Americans, driven in part by movements like Black Lives Matter, documentaries like ""What the Health,"" and a growing cadre of people who connect personal health, animal welfare and social justice with the fight for racial equality. Athletes like Kyrie Irving of the Boston Celtics and pop stars like the singer Jhene Aiko are bringing a certain pop culture cachet. Cookbook authors and a new breed of vegan soul food restaurants offer culinary muscle.

Like many food trends that seem new, black veganism has historical roots. Eating vegan has long been a practice, especially for followers of religious and spiritual movements like Rastafarianism and the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem, a religious group with black nationalist underpinnings that rose up in the 1960s and still runs a chain of vegan restaurants in cities like Atlanta; Tallahassee, Fla., and Tel Aviv.

 Avoiding meat is also a core principle of the Nation of Islam, whose founders believed that pork was at the heart of the slave diet, and preached vegetarianism as the most healthful diet for African-Americans. Many people who give up eating animal products do it for their health, or for animal welfare. The same is true for the new veganism among African-Americans, but there is an added layer of another kind of politics.

""It's not just about I want to eat well so I can live long and be skinny,"" said Jenne Claiborne, a personal chef and cooking teacher who recently moved to Los Angeles from New York. Her first cookbook, ""Sweet Potato Soul,"" is due out in February. ""For a lot of black people, it's also the social justice and food access. The food we have been eating for decades and decades and has been killing us."" Ms. Claiborne, 30, is part of a new generation of vegan cooks who are transforming traditional soul food dishes, digging deeper into the West African roots of Southern cooking and infusing new recipes with the tastes of the Caribbean. As a result, ideas about the dull vegan stews and stir-fries that were standard-bearers among the early generations of black vegan cooks are changing -- albeit slowly.

""Some folks are kind of stuck in the '70s,"" said Jessica B. Harris, 69, an author and a food scholar of the African diaspora. ""Their food seems to come with a dashiki. And don't tell me it's like fried chicken when it's tofu."" Bryant Terry cooks to counter the old ideas about vegan food. The chef-in-residence at the Museum of the African Diaspora in San Francisco, Mr. Terry, 43, wrote ""Afro-Vegan: Farm-Fresh African, Caribbean and Southern Flavors Remixed,"" a 2014 cookbook that regularly makes it to the top 10 soul food cookbook rankings on Amazon. His recipe for millet cakes is bright with the brick-red Ethiopian spice blend berbere. He likes to serve it with a sauce built from roasted green peppers, garlic and cilantro, and infused with heat from jalapenos.

""In some ways, it's a quiet wink to the '70s-style macrobiotic veggie burgers,"" he said. But it pales in comparison to what a new batch of black vegan cooks are doing. ""I cook like someone's grandma,"" he added. ""What I'm really excited about are some of the younger chefs who are professionally trained and know how to put food together in a new way."" One of them is Ms. Claiborne, who grew up in suburban Atlanta and moved to New York after college to pursue an acting career. Her father was raised vegan, according to Hebrew Israelite beliefs, and still eats that way 90 percent of the time, she said. She grew up eating everything but red meat, and learned to cook soul food at her grandmother's side. Ms. Claiborne wasn't a vegan when she started a food blog in 2010 as a way to pass the time between auditions. That came a year later, when she got a job at Peacefood Cafe in Manhattan. Now she dedicates herself to countering the notion that soul food has to include meat, and that childhood classics need milk or butter.

She adds butternut squash to sweet potato pie to create the texture usually contributed by eggs. Oyster mushrooms stand in for shrimp in Creole etouffee. She puts jackfruit in her jambalaya and cooks down collard greens with soy sauce and smoked paprika instead of pork. Health is often not enough of a reason for people to give up meat, she said. The challenges that come with being black in America can be. ""When it's bigger than you, and it's political and it's spiritual, that is an entrance point for people,"" she said. The toughest cultural touchstone to let go of is fried chicken, she said. ""People tell me: 'I can't do without the chicken. I'd rather die a painful death than have to give up chicken,'"" she said. To help, she created spicy chicken-fried cauliflower, in which she builds a crunchy crust by dipping large florets into heavily seasoned flour and then a wet batter of hot sauce, Dijon mustard and soy milk.

African-American sports stars have embraced vegan diets as a way to improve their performance. Serena and Venus Williams say they try to eat vegan most of the time. The former N.F.L. linebacker David Carter (nicknamed the 300-Pound Vegan) stopped eating animal products a few years ago. In an article this month in The Bleacher Report, Kip Andersen, the director of the documentary ""What the Health,"" was quoted as saying that so many professional basketball players had given up meat that the league might soon be called the N.V.A. -- the National Vegan Association. Hip-hop artists have embraced veganism as part of a larger effort to improve the health of their fans. Last year, the Atlanta based rapper who goes by the name Grey had a minor internet hit with a vegan Thanksgiving rap. And in April, several vegan-friendly performers gathered at the Schomburg Center in Harlem to formally introduce health and wellness as ""the 10th element of hip-hop."" (Although there is some debate over what that list should be, the other nine on that list are breaking, M.C.'ing, graffiti art, D.J.-ing, beatboxing, street fashion, language, knowledge and entrepreneurialism.)

Then again, sometimes it's just about eating something delicious and having fun. To that end, cooks in several cities have begun hosting black-focused vegan food festivals and ""mac downs,"" where hundreds of people compete in vegan mac-and-cheese competitions. In Baltimore last August, the Vegan SoulFest attracted nearly 10,000 people, said Naijha Wright-Brown, 45, who opened the vegan soul food bistro The Land of Kush in 2011 with her husband, Greg Brown, and owns five ""Black Vegans Rock"" T-shirts. Theirs is one of dozens of new black-owned vegan restaurants that have popped up recently in cities like Los Angeles, Detroit and New York.","African-Americans are going meatless in growing numbers, for reasons that range from politics to pop culture.",54b40791-1d9a-544a-bc77-5291b9926f40,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/dining/29vegans1/29vegan1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=63e4170cc8f7d2e85fc2669af5a516d5a6589edf0562aafc2a56aef1e2d37549&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Monique Koch, a vegan family coach who is also known as the Brown Vegan on YouTube, leading a cooking class at the fourth annual Baltimore Vegan SoulFest in August.

Music,Lil Baby Earns His First No. 1 Album With a Huge Streaming Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/arts/music/lil-baby-my-turn-billboard.html,"The Atlanta rapper Lil Baby scored his first No. 1 on Billboard's album chart this week, with the omnipresent Latin pop star Bad Bunny starting close behind him.

Lil Baby's ""My Turn,"" with appearances by Lil Wayne, Lil Uzi Vert, Future and others, had the equivalent of 197,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen. The vast majority of that activity came from streaming -- with 262 million clicks, ""My Turn"" had the biggest streaming week in six months, since Post Malone's ""Hollywood's Bleeding"" notched 365 million in September.

Lil Baby's rise has been quick. In four years, he has released seven full-length collections -- landing three others in the Top 5 -- and racked up more than 12 billion streams around the world.

Dance,April Is the Cruelest Month,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/12/arts/dance/brooklyn-ballets-spring-show-with-a-little-christmas-added.html,"Brooklyn Ballet, which includes classical and street dancers, is an ambitious enterprise. That's a gentle way of saying it's all over the map. For ""Vectors, Marys, and Snow,"" the company's spring program, seen last weekend at the Actors Fund Arts Center, Brooklyn Ballet unveiled a handful of works, including excerpts from its forthcoming ""Brooklyn Nutcracker."" It's true that there was a bracing chill in the air, but Tchaikovsky in April is just cruel.

Formed in 2002 by the artistic director, Lynn Parkerson, the company opened with ""The Solitude,"" by its resident choreographer Julia K. Gleich. Set to live viola, the piece explores loneliness in fairly simplistic terms: As four dancers perform short movement phrases laced with attitude turns and head rolls, a fifth stares despondently into space.

Ms. Gleich creates a bigger challenge for herself in ""Quilt/One Night Stand.""

Art & Design,Always Finding Space for One More Piece of Outsider Art,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/arts/design/monty-blanchard-art-interview.html,"Always Finding Space for One More Piece of Outsider Art

Monty Blanchard, president of the American Folk Art Museum, and his companion of 10 years, Leslie Tcheyan, a jewelry designer, do have one blank spot left on a wall of their TriBeCa apartment -- but just one. The rest of the soaring three-bedroom loft (including the bathrooms and kitchen) is filled with art, reflecting work by untrained and outsider artists -- predominantly American, but also European -- as well as Indian and Indonesian art; photography; African and Oceanic currency; Japanese ceramics; found industrial objects; and Chinese funerary items. Yet they always manage to make room for more, as they will probably do after visiting the annual Outsider Art Fair this week at the Metropolitan Pavilion in Manhattan. Mr. Blanchard, a former investment banker who became president of the museum in 2011, started collecting art with the mother of his three grown daughters, Anne Hill Blanchard, who died in 2002. He and Ms. Tcheyan moved in together in 2010.

""We both lived on the Upper East Side in more traditional lofts,"" Mr. Blanchard said. ""When we came here, the ceiling height and the light helped the art completely open up. We'd put it up and then at some point later we'd say, 'Oh, my goodness, look at what's going on between this piece and that piece and the other piece.'"" They typically spend $1,000 to $15,000 on an artwork, buying what they viscerally respond to, toting empty carry-on bags on trips in anticipation of purchases. Their collection ranges from a tinfoil wolverine ($100) to a large Martin Ramirez train ($100,000). There are works by recognized masters (Bill Traylor, Thornton Dial, Achilles Rizzoli) and anonymous creators, like the grandmother whose crocheted work was created in a Maine assisted-living center for people with dementia. In 1998, Mr. Blanchard gave more than 75 pieces to the American Folk Art Museum, but he and Ms. Tcheyan rarely sell anything -- and keep very little in storage. Below are excerpts from our conversation. Which piece would you grab first in a fire? MONTY BLANCHARD The Bill Traylor running rabbit. That piece has the combination of fluidity and solidity -- of stasis and dynamism -- that you find in great art. I also particularly like the fact that the color scheme is not obvious. It's very subtle and yet harmonious.

How do you approach the Outsider Art Fair? LESLIE TCHEYAN We don't go once, we don't go twice; we go every day, all day. What motivates you to collect this work? BLANCHARD What I respond to is artists almost always coming from outside the mainstream who have a unique or distinctive and coherent vision that is related to their own personal authenticity as opposed to being related to the current trends in the art world. Why include trained artists, like your two recent purchases by Terence Koh? BLANCHARD They fit in entirely. His combination of the intensity that he works in, the natural roughness of what he does. It's like they've always been here. Do you ultimately want to give your collection to one museum? BLANCHARD That would be my preference. But it may not be that there is any institution that would want the whole thing. Do you change things around often? BLANCHARD We don't do a regular rotation. When we lend something out, we fill up that space and when the piece comes back it has to compete. And sometimes, when we get new things, it causes us to rethink. TCHEYAN So far these walls just keep absorbing everything. Why do you keep one square of white space in the bedroom? TCHEYAN One reason is to tweak Monty every morning; he wakes up and he goes, ""Ah, that white space, what are we going to put there?"" But also because it's telling you this collection is not finished. There's so much more to find.","Monty Blanchard, president of the American Folk Art Museum, and Leslie Tcheyan have little wall space left for their vast art collection.",785cdc20-34fe-5f4e-a133-e45b5d256a27,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/20/arts/20SHOWUSYOURWALL/20SHOWUSYOURWALL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=af33a88fdca26c9aec683f8df9f2206360870c639046be23f04017d311cabe6f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Monty Blanchard and Leslie Tcheyan with their salon-style presentation of outsider and other art, at their TriBeCa home.",785cdc20-34fe-5f4e-a133-e45b5d256a27,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1785cdc20-34fe-5f4e-a133-e45b5d256a27.jpg,14,14
Media,"'Am I Going to Have to Put Mickey Mouse in ""American Horror Story""?'",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/business/media/ryan-murphy-fox-disney.html,"'Am I Going to Have to Put Mickey Mouse in ""American Horror Story""?'

PASADENA, Calif. -- A top Fox TV executive said she was ""shocked"" when the deal between 21st Century Fox and the Walt Disney Company was announced. One of Fox's most prolific hitmakers, Ryan Murphy, said he was ""very emotional"" and weighing whether he would stick around when his deal with the studio ended later this year. Now that Rupert Murdoch has agreed to sell much of 21st Century Fox to Disney, there are many questions about what the fallout will be for Fox's vast and lucrative television properties. On Thursday, at a Television Critics Association news media event, top Fox executives tried to emphasize that it would be ""business as usual"" -- at least over the next year -- at both the TV studio and the broadcast network. ""We have to operate as if this deal might not go through,"" said Gary Newman, co-chairman of the Fox Television group.

But if regulators approve the deal -- which Mr. Newman said he expected to happen -- it will disrupt the television industry, consolidating key properties within the Disney fold and potentially sending important producers and executives running for the gates. Mr. Murphy, the creator of hit shows like ""American Horror Story,"" ""Glee"" and ""Feud: Bette and Joan,"" has a deal with Fox's television studio, which produces shows for the Fox broadcast network, FX and other channels. Now, he could become one of the biggest free agents in Hollywood. ""Three months ago, I thought I would be literally buried on the Fox lot,"" he said. Mr. Murphy initially had concerns about the deal, he said, because he has worked so closely with Fox executives for years, and his edgier content is not exactly in keeping with Disney's brand. ""Am I going to have to put Mickey Mouse in 'American Horror Story'?"" he said. (He added that Disney executives had assured him that he would not.)

Mr. Murphy has only rarely taken on projects outside Fox, though he did reach a deal with Netflix last year to make a series about Nurse Ratched, from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" Netflix has said it will spend up to $8 billion on content this year. Disney bought Fox's properties to beef up its own streaming service, meaning Mr. Murphy's next move will be one of the most consequential in the industry.

Mr. Murphy said he was reassured by Disney's successful attempts at integrating companies like Marvel and Lucasfilm and by a phone call with the company's chief executive, Robert A. Iger.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""I'm sort of interested to see what that company is going to look like before I make any decisions,"" he said. Another key is the future of the Fox broadcast network. While Fox's TV studio would become a Disney property, the broadcast network would join the Murdoch-controlled company New Fox, which would also include Fox Sports and Fox News. But without an accompanying TV studio making programs, there's a strong belief among TV executives that the broadcast network -- responsible for hits like ""The Simpsons,"" ""24"" and ""Empire"" -- would be a significantly less ambitious home for TV. With live ratings dwindling for all the broadcast networks, there has been an increased emphasis to buy shows from an in-house studio to keep revenue streams high. Fox executives said Disney management had reassured them that they would not have to soften any of Fox's edgier content. ""They are not acquiring Fox to somehow turn it into some form of P.G. company,"" Mr. Newman said. Dana Walden, co-chief executive of Fox's television group, said any existing shows on Fox would remain on Fox and not transfer to Disney's ABC. She also emphasized that space on a broadcast network calendar remained a lucrative property, and that Mr. Murdoch's new company could ask for an ownership stake in any new TV show that it bought from an outside studio.","Executives and creators for Fox TV, including Ryan Murphy, the man behind ""American Horror Story"" and ""Glee,"" are weighing their futures if the Disney deal goes through.",04b2c1af-17bb-5a3d-b330-d6bbe24ae847,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/05/business/05FOX1/05FOX1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=58df1da56f0196da1a63a384aeb32e41584ee41148b569ce196947f1b47eaf44&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ryan Murphy, the creator of ""Glee"" and ""Feud,"" has a deal with Fox that expires this year.

Good morning. Close followers of our exploits here in Newsletterville know that on Wednesdays we don't always cook from recipes. On this one, the first of 2016, we'll brook no exception. We'll toss some half-moons of peeled parsnip into a saute pan foaming with unsalted butter, caramelize them in the heat, then put the result into a bowl with some steaming pasta, more butter, a shower of torn mint leaves and a drift of grated Parmesan: Dinner!

Improvisation is not for everyone, of course. And so Cooking has plenty of sheet music. We're jazzed for Julia Moskin's definitive new recipe for whole-roasted cauliflower, which accompanies her terrific reporting on the subject of cooking it in today's Food section of The Times.

We can't wait to make Melissa Clark's new recipe for skillet chicken with tomatoes and mozzarella, which you may end up calling pizza chicken when you make it twice a month all winter long.

Fashion & Style,Fashion From Marlo Thomas: 'That Girl' Shifts to 'That Woman',https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/fashion/marlo-thomas-fashion-home-shopping-network.html,"It was the week before the inauguration, and Marlo Thomas, the actress, author and second-wave feminist activist, was wrestling with whether or not to join her old friend and collaborator, Gloria Steinem, at the Women's March on Washington. The timing was complicated: Ms. Thomas was about to unveil a clothing line for the Home Shopping Network called ""That Woman,"" which meant a trip to Tampa, Fla., for an on-air selling marathon, along with a couple of mall appearances, in the days leading up to the march. ""That Woman,"" of course, had been named to evoke ""That Girl,"" Ms. Thomas's television show from the late 1960s that was a feminist touchstone. Airing from 1966 to 1971, ""That Girl"" was Ann Marie: a young, single working woman, living alone in New York City, and a proxy for Ms. Thomas. As part of her pitch to ABC, whose executives warned that the concept just wouldn't sell, Ms. Thomas gave the head of programming a copy of Betty Friedan's book ""The Feminine Mystique."" When those same network executives pushed for the series to conclude with Ann and her boyfriend, Donald, a magazine writer played by Ted Bessell, getting married, Ms. Thomas pushed back. Their engagement during the fifth and final season was the compromise, though the last episode found them stuck on an elevator, arguing about who had the most power in the relationship. Ms. Thomas used her considerable comedic chops to defang the cultural threat posed by Ann's implicit power as an unmarried woman. (As she learned from her father, comedy can be a Trojan Horse for all sorts of subversions.)

And she used fashion to distinguish herself from her television forebears. She shed the housewife gear, the demure shifts, Peter Pan collars and aprons sported by Lucille Ball, Donna Reed and even Elizabeth Montgomery, for the uniform of the '60s youthquake -- graphic, eye-popping designs from Andre Courreges and Mary Quant -- to be followed by the more bohemian accouterments of the early '70s, like the styles of Halston, Giorgio di Sant' Angelo and Yves St. Laurent. ""That Woman"" -- a collection of 15 pieces and a tote -- is not going to make fashion history. But it is the first commercial product that Ms. Thomas, now 79, has put her name on in decades, and she is proud of it, even though it might surprise those who know her as a founder in 1973 of the Ms. Foundation, with Ms. Steinem, Letty Cottin Pogrebin and Patricia Carbine, to fund social justice efforts; or as the mistress-mind behind ""Free to Be ... You and Me,"" an album, best-selling book and TV show upending gender stereotypes. ""David Geffen once told me that the problem with having too many options is that if you don't play one, you might as well not have any,"" Ms. Thomas said of her more recent project. ""So I decided to play an option. But my way, so I'm in control of everything.""

That's the spandex, she said. ""People make decisions about how they should look at a given age,"" Ms. Thomas continued. ""But I think you should keep in mind how you move and how you sit. I like things that show a little skin somewhere, something that makes you feel, as you're standing in a room full of men, that you're not just one of the guys."" Ms. Thomas sat astride paisley floor pillows in the glassy living room of the Fifth Avenue penthouse she shares with her husband, Phil Donahue, long America's favorite male feminist and talk-show host. You could see Central Park stretched out in its entirety beyond the terrace walls. The two fell in love, on the air, in 1977, when she was a guest on ""The Phil Donahue Show."" Ms. Thomas has the video that proves it. (You can find the clip on YouTube; their fumbling, instant rapport is deeply adorable.) ""We flirted for the whole hour, to an embarrassing degree,"" she said. ""He asked me if I would ever get married, and I said, 'Never.' I talked about feminism and why marriage was not a good institution for women, how marriages were only good for one and a half people."" Ms. Thomas's traditionally married parents were an example she was not eager to emulate. Her Italian mother, Rose Marie, was a singer with a radio program when she met the comedian Danny Thomas, whose Lebanese background was as patriarchal as her own, so there was no question whose career would come first. Still, Ms. Thomas and Mr. Donahue started dating the day after the show. At the time, he was living with four sons from his first marriage, to Margaret Cooney (their daughter was living with her mother), frat-house style, as Ms. Thomas recalled. Not only was Ms. Thomas, then in her early 40s, used to living alone, but, she said, ""I wasn't used to that many towels and jock straps; I had never been with a man before who had 'Dad' written on his underwear."" In 1966, when ""That Girl"" went on the air, the birth control pill was still illegal in many states. It wasn't until 1972 that the Supreme Court ruled that contraception in any form could be distributed to single people. As these cases churned through the judicial system, ""That Girl"" remained so chaste that Donald's bare ankles were a plot device.

Musing on how culture evolves in fits and starts, Ms. Thomas said, ""When I played Jennifer Aniston's mother on 'Friends,' and they talked about the wet spot on the bed, I thought, 'Oh my God, wouldn't Donald turn over?'"" How women are depicted on television reached a high point, Ms. Thomas said, with ""Roseanne"" -- Roseanne Barr's irascible character on the ABC sitcom that ran for nearly a decade starting in 1988. ""She was the first woman who dared to be unlikable,"" Ms. Thomas said. ""Me and Mary were good girls. But Roseanne was a woman who hated her children, who ever says that? She was the Jackie Gleason"" of female role models. Like Lena Dunham, Ms. Thomas said, Ms. Barr showed that you can be a role model without being perfect. Ms. Thomas and Ms. Steinem were introduced by a (male) agent, who proposed a film project in which Ms. Thomas would portray Ms. Steinem when she went undercover as a Playboy bunny. ""Boy, I don't know which one of you I'd like to sleep with first,"" he told them in his office, she recalled in her 2010 memoir, ""Growing Up Laughing"" -- except he used a different verb. ""Boy, did he pick the wrong two women to say that to,"" Ms. Thomas wrote. Ms. Steinem said later, ""Two friends have different memories, but I probably still owe her a script."" Nonetheless, she added: ""We recognized in each other two women who were trying to forge a life that was different from what we'd been brought up to do. I can't express how terrible the 1950s were. You really were brought up to believe your life would be shaped by your husband's needs and your children's needs. This made marriage seem a lot like death."" When Ms. Thomas and Mr. Donahue married in 1980, Ms. Thomas said she felt as though she was abandoning Ms. Steinem. ""I wrote her a letter,"" she recalled, ""saying that this may be the challenge of sisterhood, that we can take different paths.""

Ms. Steinem, whose speech at the Women's March this month noted the upside of a long life -- ""You remember,"" she said, ""when things were much worse"" -- recalled how for a long time Ms. Thomas, being an actor, had fudged her age. ""But when she turned 60, someone reported it. So Marlo said, 'You can imagine how hard it is to be 60 when you've never been 40 or 50.'"" In 2014, Ms. Thomas was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- the same year Meryl Streep received hers, as it happens -- for her social justice advocacy and her work with the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the free pediatric cancer research and treatment center in Memphis founded by her father. ""I got a flash of my grandparents who were immigrants from Lebanon and came here with their belongings in sacks,"" she said. ""What would they think of my standing here at the White House? I choked up. I am a second-generation Italian and Lebanese person. Both sets of grandparents were in arranged marriages. I've often thought, 'What would they think of me who took my own sweet time to get married to the man I chose?' They didn't have that freedom."" Though Ms. Thomas had campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, she declined to talk politics. (And she had to sit out the Women's March, it turned out, because of a bug she caught in Florida. ""I hated to miss it,"" she said. ""I marched all over the country for the E.R.A. I've marched for pro-choice. Phil and I march together in the Gay Pride Parade. It was hard not being there."") ""Let me turn this into a comedic bit,"" Ms. Thomas said of the election. ""I love that people are discovering there's fake news. If you're a public person, you've been living with fake news your entire life, only you've been clawing the walls, asking yourself, 'Why are they saying that?'""","The actress, also known for the Ms. Foundation and her marriage to Phil Donahue, has created 15 pieces to sell on the Home Shopping Network.",0f83bd5d-708a-5a57-a875-3ed48c833ec8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/25/fashion/26MARLO/26MARLO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=ef8ae0464a3de0b4c6c7372321b377f75f946a8458283a0471dc3f0146ad09d0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The actress Marlo Thomas has created 15 pieces for her new clothing line 'That Woman.'

Science,Astronomers Measure Distance to Farthest Galaxy Yet,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/science/astronomers-measure-distance-to-farthest-galaxy-yet.html,"Leapfrogging backward in time to when the universe was apparently feeling its oats, a group of astronomers reported Tuesday that they had measured a bona fide distance to one of the farthest and thus earliest galaxies known.

The galaxy, more than a few billion light-years on the other side of the northern constellation Bootes, is one of the most massive and brightest in the early universe and goes by the name of EGS-zs8-1. It flowered into stardom only 670 million years after the Big Bang.

The light from that galaxy has taken 13 billion years to reach telescopes on Earth. By now, however, since the universe has continued to expand during that time, the galaxy is about 30 billion light-years away, according to standard cosmological calculations.

The new measurements allow astronomers to see the galaxy in its infancy. Despite its relative youth, however, it is already about one-sixth as massive as the Milky Way, which is 10 billion years old. And it is getting bigger, making stars 80 times faster than the Milky Way is making them today. The discovery was reported in The Astrophysical Journal by Pascal Oesch of Yale University and his colleagues.","The exceptionally luminous galaxy, EGS-zs8-1, is already about one-sixth as massive as the Milky Way and making stars 80 times faster than our galaxy.",66ba24a9-ee6a-5bd7-b218-46d72b00842d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/06/science/06GALAXY/06GALAXY-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=523&w=1000&s=4345a82824ab157555ec71a38eb080d0b1189f7fe3bfc7bc8e7f43a0e38a227c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The farthest confirmed galaxy observed to date was identified in this Hubble image of a field of galaxies.  The inset image of the galaxy has been colored blue as suggestive of its young stars.,66ba24a9-ee6a-5bd7-b218-46d72b00842d,Demo_data/D1_imgs/166ba24a9-ee6a-5bd7-b218-46d72b00842d.jpg,2,20
Media,Even C-SPAN Is Piqued: Senate Puts Limits on Trial Coverage,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/19/business/media/senate-impeachment-trial-media.html,"News coverage of President Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate began last week with a Republican senator calling a CNN reporter ""a liberal hack"" in the halls of Congress and laughing about it later that night during a Fox News interview. Journalists are up in arms about new restrictions on their movement inside the Capitol, which they say will prevent them from easily interviewing lawmakers about the proceedings. The rules, negotiated by Republican Senate leadership, have yet to be written down, causing confusion among reporters and the Capitol Police expected to enforce them. Even sedate C-SPAN is aggrieved, calling on the Senate to allow its television crews to document the trial, instead of the government-controlled cameras that -- as was the case during Bill Clinton's trial 21 years ago -- will limit what viewers see and hear inside the Senate chamber.

The pretrial tensions suggest that the bash-the-press mentality that led the White House to kill off the daily briefing and strip reporters of their credentials has now crept into what senators like to call ""the world's greatest deliberative body."" ""There's long been this understanding that we both serve the same people at the end of the day, and that it's a mutually beneficial relationship,"" said Sarah Wire, a Los Angeles Times reporter who leads a committee of congressional correspondents. ""Senators want to talk to us because they know we're communicating their message to their voters back home."" ""All this,"" she added in an interview, ""was kind of a shock."" ""This"" is a series of restrictions abruptly imposed on reporters shortly before the start of the trial, where opening arguments are set to begin Tuesday. Instead of unfettered access to the hallways and corridors surrounding the Senate chamber -- a tradition for decades -- journalists will be confined to roped-off pens as senators come and go from the trial. Walk-and-talk interviews with senators, a staple of congressional reporting made famous by TV shows like ""The West Wing,"" will be curtailed.

Journalists have long been barred from entering the Senate chamber, relegated to an overhead view from the press gallery above. Now, to enter the upstairs gallery, they will need to queue up for a magnetometer meant to sniff out illicit electronics, raising concerns about their ability to quickly relay to the public what is happening inside. The effect, reporters say, is to make it harder to chronicle the you-are-there details expected of a historic political moment -- including which senators are doodling or snoozing during testimony. In stark contrast with the coverage of State of the Union addresses, a few stationary cameras controlled by a Senate office, rather than an independent news organization, will provide the only viewpoint of the trial floor.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""Those cameras operate under very strict guidelines: They show the person who is speaking, and maybe some wide shots,"" Terry Murphy, vice president for programming at C-SPAN, said in an interview. ""They can't show others reacting or listening. Having our own cameras in there would allow us to cover the trial with a much more full picture of what's going on."" C-SPAN wrote to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, in December, formally requesting access. As of Saturday, the network had heard nothing back.

The American news media has come a long way since the country's first impeachment trial, of President Andrew Johnson, in 1868, when House impeachment managers sat for a still portrait by the famed Civil War photographer Mathew Brady. The Clinton impeachment trial was the first to take place in the age of 24-hour cable news. But journalists in 1999 did not have to contend with the minute-by-minute demands of digital media. Mr. Trump's impeachment trial will be the first to be dissected in real-time -- and possibly by the Twitter-happy president himself. On Capitol Hill, parties on both sides of the lawmaker-journalist divide say discussions about access are active. First Amendment groups like the American Civil Liberties Union have weighed in to decry the new limits. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press gathered signatures from 57 news organizations objecting to the rules. Elisabeth Bumiller, an assistant managing editor and the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times, said in a statement that the restrictions ""will severely limit the ability of reporters to gather news during one of the most historic events in the nation's history."" ""These limits are far more burdensome than the rules that govern press access in the Capitol, even those in effect during the last impeachment trial, and will prevent journalists from freely documenting a public debate in Congress,"" Ms. Bumiller said. Mr. McConnell's office, which controls the business of the Senate, declined to comment. On Capitol Hill, there is speculation that the restrictions were put in place because Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial, will be present in the chamber each day. Typically, reporters' movements in the Capitol are limited when high-profile people visit, like Vice President Mike Pence. But congressional correspondents said that, even after several meetings with Senate officials, they did not know why the restrictions had been put in place.

Theater,SITI Company Announces Final Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/theater/siti-company-final-season.html,"After 30 seasons, Anne Bogart and Tadashi Suzuki's famed experimental New York theater company will take its final bow in 2022.

The Saratoga International Theater Institute, better known as SITI Company, announced today that it will stop touring and performing shows after its 30th and final season, which it anticipates will run through Fall 2022. ""This was a very emotional and personal decision,"" Bogart, the company's co-artistic director, said in an interview on Tuesday. ""Some of the actors have been with the company for around 30 years.""

But the company is far from finished, Bogart said. Training and teaching will continue after 2022, and some members, herself included, will continue to work on theatrical projects together. ""There's an appetite for the classes like you wouldn't believe,"" she said.","After three decades, the noted experimental New York theater company will stop producing shows in 2022.",be3a02d2-dbcc-57d0-b04b-ff84ae25367a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/08/arts/07siti-2/07siti-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=ef13ebbd007c8fd61d04d6d8fe4c8b7b9ba06da561889668290091dbfc23c6ea&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Members of SITI Company and Streb Extreme Action rehearsing their 2019 collaboration &ldquo;Falling &amp; Loving&rdquo; at Montclair State University.,be3a02d2-dbcc-57d0-b04b-ff84ae25367a,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1be3a02d2-dbcc-57d0-b04b-ff84ae25367a.jpg,10,10
Theater,"In the Absence of Live Theater, TV Takes, Well, Center Stage",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/theater/review-staged-talking-heads.html,"Can we add Michael Sheen and David Tennant to the list of defining double-acts of our time? That's one response to the giddy pleasures of ""Staged,"" a delicious comedy series made for the BBC that owes its existence to the theatrical desolation of the coronavirus pandemic. Had this theater season gone as normal, the director Simon Evans would have been engaged at the Chichester Festival Theater south of London, reviving Tom Stoppard's play ""The Real Thing."" Instead, Evans has written and directed a six-episode TV sitcom, with Sheen and Tennant as the often fractious co-stars of a revival of the Pirandello play ""Six Characters in Search of an Author"" that's been postponed. The result gives new meaning to making a virtue of necessity. Available on BBC iPlayer for the next 11 months, ""Staged"" represents a quick-witted response to our bereft theatrical scene. It's a win for all involved. Throw in cameos from Samuel L. Jackson and a hilariously bossy Judi Dench and you have a comic essay in contrasts: Tennant, the lank-haired Scotsman, plays opposite the shaggy Welshman that is Sheen in lockdown. They are joined by their real-life partners, Georgia Tennant and Anna Lundberg, in a sequence of short episodes that play with reality in a way that Pirandello himself might recognize. (""It's like something out of the damn play,"" Sheen remarks.)

And though the impetus of ""Staged"" is the one-upmanship of its male leads, the impact of Covid-19 is felt, too, in shots of a weirdly still London and a subplot about an elderly neighbor of Sheen's who falls ill. (Visual tributes to Britain's National Health Service are in evidence as well.) At such moments, unstoppable comic energy gives way to contemplation as we recognize our strange times even as the artists lift our spirits.

If ""Staged"" represents rambunctious entertainment of an unusually high order, ""Talking Heads"" lets us savor the transfixing power of the solo voice. Also available on BBC iPlayer, this remake of a series of vaunted television monologues by Alan Bennett, along with two new ones, owes its existence as well to the absence of live theater. In a virus-free world, the director Nicholas Hytner, a two-time Tony winner, would have been shepherding ""The Southbury Child,"" a play by Stephen Beresford that was due to open at Hytner's Bridge Theater in southeast London in April. Instead, the BBC approached him in March about overseeing a fresh take on these revelatory solo works from Bennett, the 86-year-old English playwright and a close friend and colleague. And though filmed for TV as before, ""Talking Heads"" suggests a further life in the theater. Not only is the work's scale ideal for social distancing (there's a lot less to worry about with a cast of one), but many of the previous ""Talking Heads"" titles later came to London and New York stages in various groupings. Bennett's writings must look like an even more attractive option nowadays in an industry encouraged by the pandemic to think small. (Their West End iteration won two Olivier Awards, London's equivalent of the Tonys, in 1992.)

The first time, Bennett's contained studies in self-deception and desolation attracted major names, among them Patricia Routledge, Eileen Atkins and, in one of her finest performances, Maggie Smith. So it comes as no surprise to find in the current lineup a female-heavy roster, including the stage and screen veterans Lesley Manville and Kristin Scott Thomas and younger faces like Jodie Comer from ""Killing Eve."" Scott Thomas is in peak form in ""The Hand of God,"" in which she plays Celia, a gently snobbish antique dealer who, to her lasting discredit, fails to clock the importance of a sketch that slips into the possession of a very lucky buyer. Her sparkling eyes dimming as the extent of her folly is made clear, Celia -- as is so often the case with Bennett's characters -- finishes her half-hour tale in a wounded, aggrieved state at some remove from her initial good cheer. Forever tugging at her sleeves, Scott Thomas captures this deluded woman's gathering discomfort, and she is abetted by her director, Jonathan Kent, a prominent name who has also been brought into Bennett's orbit. Surprises of a different sort await two other Bennett heroines. In ""The Shrine,"" the 2019 Olivier Award winner Monica Dolan (""All About Eve"") unravels as her character, the newly bereaved Lorna, realizes that her deceased biker husband, Clifford, had a whole separate life. One of two new titles -- the other is ""An Ordinary Woman,"" with Sarah Lancashire -- ""The Shrine"" proceeds to a teary finish that is unusual for Bennett, whose characters don't normally betray their emotions so freely. Hytner directs as a master conductor would work through a new score from a favorite composer: Every beat counts. And no praise is too high for another stage stalwart, Harriet Walter, in ""Soldiering On."" Walter brings microscopic attention to her portrait of the poshly spoken, sad-eyed Muriel, a widow whose comfortable life has largely disintegrated by the time we arrive at the final frame. Her downward spiral was directed by the ever-observant Marianne Elliott, who was herself due on Broadway this season as director of the musical revival ""Company."" First performed over three decades ago by Stephanie Cole, ""Soldiering On"" is vintage Bennett in its mixture of rueful comedy (Muriel ponders the mourning habits of elephants) and growing despair. Things may be ""not all gloom,"" or so Muriel insists to the camera -- even as her late husband's toxic legacy is laid bare. But a last look at Walter reveals otherwise. The loneliness and loss are there for all to see even if Muriel, bless her, soldiers on.","""Staged,"" a six-episode sitcom, and ""Talking Heads,"" a remake of a group of vaunted monologues, show what good can come of a bereft theatrical scene in Britain.",ee0bd1d1-7984-5530-b9f2-8c87e040e8df,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/09/arts/09london-theater1/09london-theater1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=d64176745533e2cb899158d01e94eb7ec237c83a67f71c61998da1adf9053eb0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"David Tennant, left, and Michael Sheen play the often fractious co-stars of a postponed theatrical revival in ""Staged,"" a six-episode sitcom.",ee0bd1d1-7984-5530-b9f2-8c87e040e8df,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1ee0bd1d1-7984-5530-b9f2-8c87e040e8df.jpg,10,10

Art & Design,"MoMA to Close, Then Open Doors to More Expansive View of Art",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/arts/design/moma-museum-renovation.html," The second-, fourth- and fifth-floor galleries will continue to form the chronological spine of exhibitions, but in expanded form. The red line on the second floor traces the expansion into the former Folk Art Museum and the Jean Nouvel building. The fourth and fifth floors contain the Studio. The second floor houses the Daylit Gallery. At street level are a gallery and the Projects Room.

As the Museum of Modern Art begins the final stage of its $400 million overhaul, it will close for four months this summer and autumn to reconfigure its galleries, rehang the entire collection and rethink the way that the story of modern and contemporary art is presented to the public. The Picassos and van Goghs will still be there, but the 40,000 square feet of additional space will allow MoMA to focus new attention on works by women, Latinos, Asians, African-Americans and other overlooked artists like Shigeru Onishi, a Japanese experimental photographer, or Herve Telemaque, a Haitian-born painter who is now 81. With the doors closed from June 15 to Oct. 21, the museum will give up summer tourism revenue in the interest of creating a new MoMA that will abandon the discipline-based display system it has used for eight decades. Three floors of exhibition space will retain a spine of chronology, but the museum will now mix media, juxtaposing painting, sculpture, architecture, design, photography, performance, film and works on paper.

MoMA is announcing these changes and others on Tuesday. In another marked shift, the museum will rotate a selection of art in its galleries every six to nine months and draw all of the opening exhibitions from its permanent collection -- an acknowledgment that there is no single or complete history of modern and contemporary art and that many of MoMA's holdings have historically been overlooked. As a result, while visitors will still be able to count on highlights like Picasso's ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"" and van Gogh's ""The Starry Night,"" they are also likely to be exposed to less familiar names, including Okwui Okpokwasili, an Igbo-Nigerian-American artist, performer and choreographer. The renovation -- designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro in collaboration with Gensler -- will include additional space from the demolished American Folk Art Museum. Existing galleries will also expand west through 53W53, the new residential skyscraper designed by Jean Nouvel.

The museum will reopen with a survey of Latin American art, along with exhibitions by two African-American artists: Pope.L, known for his provocative performances, and Betye Saar, 92, whose collages and assemblages have often flown under the radar. ""We don't want to forget our roots in terms of having the greatest Modernist collection,"" Leon Black, the museum's chairman, said, ""but the museum didn't emphasize female artists, didn't emphasize what minority artists were doing, and it was limited on geography."" He added, ""Where those were always the exceptions, now they really should be part of the reality of the multicultural society we all live in.""

MoMA is also announcing a new partnership that will allow the Studio Museum in Harlem to present exhibitions at MoMA while its own building on 125th Street is under construction. The first exhibition at the ""Studio Museum at MoMA"" will feature the Kenyan-born artist Michael Armitage. Thelma Golden, the Studio Museum's director, will curate. The Armitage exhibition will be presented in MoMA's new Projects Gallery on the expanded ground floor which, along with the street-level gallery of architecture and design, will be free to the public. Ms. Golden described the partnership as ""a new paradigm for collaboration that looks at the different ways institutions can come together,"" adding that it was meaningful to follow in the footsteps of the former MoMA curator, Kynaston McShine. Mr. McShine, who died last year, started MoMA's Projects series in the 1970s and ""made it possible for me to see myself as a curator,"" Ms. Golden said, ""to understand my possibilities."" Mr. Lowry said the collaboration also allows MoMA ""to expand our knowledge about a range of artists we may only be vaguely familiar with.""

During its last renovation in 2004, designed by Yoshio Taniguchi, MoMA moved to temporary space in Queens for two years. Because the museum will be closed for a shorter period this time, Mr. Lowry said relocation would be unnecessary. Asked about the financial cost of the hiatus, he said the museum had budgeted to prepare for lost revenue (MoMA PS 1 will remain open). In the last few years MoMA has received what Mr. Lowry once called ""the kind of gifts you only dream about,"" namely $100 million from the entertainment mogul David Geffen. On Tuesday, MoMA will announce yet another: more than $200 million from the estate of David Rockefeller, the philanthropist and banker, who died in 2017.

The impact on tourism of a summer without MoMA remains to be seen. Fred Dixon, NYC & Company's president and chief executive, said, ""Because so much will be on offer this year, we don't anticipate seeing any negative tourism impact."" 4 Other Names to Know in Latin American Art Paving the way. Frida Kahlo is internationally renowned for the emotional intensity of her work. But she is not the only woman from Latin America to leave her mark in the art world. Here are four more to know: 1. Luchita Hurtado. For years, Hurtado worked in the shadow of her husbands and more famous peers. Her paintings, which emphasize the interconnectedness of all living things, didn't get recognition from the art world until late in her life. 2. Belkis Ayon. A Cuban printmaker, Ayon was a master in the art of collagraphy. She worked almost exclusively in black, white and gray. She used her art, focused on a secret religious fraternity, to explore the themes of humanity and spirituality. 3. Ana Mendieta. Mendieta's art was sometimes violent, often unapologetically feminist and usually raw. She incorporated natural materials like blood, dirt, water and fire, and displayed her work through photography, film and live performances. 4. Remedios Varo. Though she was born in Spain, Varo's work is indelibly linked to Mexico, where she immigrated during World War II. Her style is reminiscent of Renaissance art in its exquisite precision, but her dreamlike paintings were otherworldly in tone. In the new MoMA, some individual galleries will still be medium-specific -- but visitors will find several possible routes through the expanded museum. They will also find a new two-story Studio for live and experimental programming, including performance, dance, music, moving image and sound works. Another new space, the second-floor Platform, will be a place for visitors to make art and join conversations. ""We're trying to make a visit to the museum a comfortable, enjoyable experience that lets you move back and forth from looking at art to talking about art to thinking about art,"" Mr. Lowry said.",Don't plan to visit MoMA this summer. It's closing for renovations that will put a new focus on work by women and artists of color.

Travel,"Storm Over, Airports Are Slowly Getting Back to Normal",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/travel/storm-over-airports-are-slowly-getting-back-to-normal.html,"The snowstorm that struck the East Coast over the weekend continued to affect travel, causing the more than 1,500 North American cancellations that flight tracking services were reporting on Monday.

Two of the major airports operating service to Washington, D.C. -- Dulles and Reagan -- are operating with limited service after two days of closure. (Each says it has one runway open.) Baltimore-Washington International, which had very limited service on Sunday, is seeing fewer cancellations than any day since the storm's arrival.

The three major airports with service to New York City -- La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark -- which had been offering limited service on Sunday, are also experiencing fewer cancellations. Each currently has fewer than half of its outbound flights canceled, according to FlightAware.

And Philadelphia International Airport, which shut down on Saturday, is back to operating as well.

Every airport is urging passengers to call their carriers for up-to-the-date information. Many airlines are still offering fee waivers for itinerary changes.

Art & Design,"In Portland, Falling Stars Shine a Light on Gun Violence",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/arts/design/Hank-Willis-Thomas-retrospective-portland.html,"In the soaring atrium at the entrance to Hank Willis Thomas's exhibition ""All Things Being Equal..."" at the Portland Art Museum, a circle of 28-foot-long blue banners stitched with rows of white stars descends to the ground. Titled ""14,719,"" this immersive chapel of falling stars echoes elements of the American flag and commemorates the number of individuals shot and killed in the United States in 2018. ""The most likely way for young African-American men to die is by gun violence,"" Mr. Thomas, a conceptual artist, said in his Brooklyn studio on the eve of his first major museum survey. The Portland, Ore. , show, which opened this month, includes some 90 photographs, sculptures, installations, videos and collaborative public art projects that shine a light on painful American stories and the aspiration for social justice. "" But all you have to be is alive in America and you can fall victim to gun violence,"" Mr. Thomas said. This urgent societal issue is acutely personal to the 43-year-old artist, who in 2000 lost his first cousin -- with whom he shared an apartment in New York at the time -- to robbery and murder. ""I remember Songha and I joking about being 21 and black and, like, we made it,"" said Mr. Thomas, ruefully. His grief and search for catharsis have been formative to his development as an artist, one who often co-opts familiar cultural imagery to pose nuanced questions about black male identity.

While at the California College of the Arts, where he received his master's in photography and visual criticism in 2004, Mr. Thomas began ""Branded,"" his ongoing series of digital "" C-prints ."" He embossed the Nike swoosh logo repeatedly across a bare torso like whipping marks in ""Scarred Chest"" (2003) , one of his many images drawing parallels between the violence to black bodies during slavery and the physical labor of black athletes generating revenue for universities and team owners.

""Hank uses the language of advertising, whether it's actual words or the visual language, to think about the underpinnings that move throughout our culture and how those messages can either uplift or in many cases reinforce biases or racist practice,"" said Julia Dolan, who curated the Portland exhibition with Sara Krajewski. With his childhood friend and fellow artist Kambui Olujimi, Mr. Thomas used the G.I. Joes they once played with to re-enact the last five minutes of his cousin's life in the 2005 stop-motion animation ""Winter in America,"" on view in the exhibition. ""As boys in the United States, we're given action figures with guns and encouraged to create scenarios based around violence,"" he said. ""We then turn around and say it's a shame when gun violence happens.""

Reprinting Spider Martin's 1965 photograph of Civil Rights protesters facing off against police on a weathered glass mirror, for instance, Mr. Thomas inserts the reflection of the viewer in the narrative and conflates the past and present. Screening other images of social unrest on retroreflective vinyl, he highlights defiant figures and searing details while shrouding the rest as latent negative. Only when the viewers use the flash on their phones to alter the silvered surface of these halftones (as they will be invited to do in the exhibition) is the full image revealed. ""Depending on where you stand, the image will look different,"" Ms. Krajewski said. ""It makes us think about our relationships to these histories, how our backgrounds have positioned us in our lives.""

Mr. Thomas's sculptural works, too, are based on powerful gestures excised from photographs, including an image of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrapping his arms around his wife, Coretta Scott King. In the artist's memorial to the couple to be installed next year on the Boston Common, their disembodied embrace will be cast at 22 feet tall in bronze. ""We have so many monuments to war and very few monuments to peace and love,"" said Mr. Thomas, who lives in Brooklyn with his wife, Rujeko Hockley, co-curator of this year's Whitney Biennial, and their baby daughter. The artist was also awarded a fellowship this year by the Gordon Parks Foundation in Pleasantville, N.Y. There, Mr. Thomas's new retroreflective images based on Mr. Parks's 1969 autobiographical film ""Learning Tree"" are on view. ""Hank is living and breathing in the footsteps of Gordon Parks,"" said Peter Kunhardt Jr., executive director of the foundation . Mr. Thomas has layered stills from the film dramatizing Mr. Parks's impoverished childhood in segregated Kansas with ghostly pictures of him as a renowned artist on the set of ""Learning Tree"" and looking back at his own life through the camera lens. This framing and context is illuminated with the viewer's flash. ""I'm always interested in the story behind the pictures,"" Mr. Thomas said, ""and encouraging myself and viewers to think beyond the surface reading."" The artist's longtime friend and colleague Wangechi Mutu said she admired the ""emotional elasticity and empathetic breadth"" that Mr. Thomas brings to whatever idea and medium he tackles, as well as his ability to collaborate.","A personal loss, in part, drives the artist Hank Willis Thomas to confront one of the biggest fears among African-American men.",80103104-68b0-5053-8a9e-b5053c929d1e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/multimedia/27sp-hank4/27sp-hank4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=7579fc8392f5d8042f2c5895ceebd19fe139813ca2dd55ade4071a41a9132ae5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Public Enemy (Black and Gold),"" 2017, uses a 1967 news photo by Don Hogan Charles, originally published in The New York Times.",80103104-68b0-5053-8a9e-b5053c929d1e,Demo_data/D1_imgs/180103104-68b0-5053-8a9e-b5053c929d1e.jpg,14,20
Health,Are New Drugs for Hepatitis C Safe? A Report Raises Concerns,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/health/hepatitis-c-antiviral-drug-study.html," The number of adverse events appears relatively small, and the findings are not conclusive. But experts said the report was a warning that should not be ignored. It involves nine widely used antiviral drugs that were heralded as a huge advance because they greatly increased cure rates, seemingly with few side effects. The report will be published online on Wednesday by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a nonprofit in Horsham, Pa., that studies drug safety. Its findings are based on the group's analysis of the Food and Drug Administration's database of reports from doctors around the world of adverse events that might be related to medications. Dr. Robert S. Brown, the director of the Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation at NewYork-Presbyterian at Columbia and Weill Cornell, who was not involved in the study, said that there had been other, scattered accounts of problems with the new drugs and that they should be investigated further.

""We don't want people to ignore it and lead to risks to patients,"" he said. ""We don't want people to overreact and not treat patients who should be treated. A lot of doctors are unclear about it, and if doctors are unclear, patients are, too."" Dr. Brown added that problems might arise from some doctors' prescribing incorrectly, giving the drugs to patients with liver function too poor to tolerate them or benefit from them. Hepatitis C is an enormous public health problem. Caused by a virus, it leads to chronic liver disease in most people who contract it, and some eventually develop cirrhosis and liver cancer. In the United States, an estimated 2.7 million to 3.9 million people have chronic hepatitis C, at least 20,000 a year die from it and it is the leading cause of liver transplants, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, the World Health Organization reports 130 million to 150 million current chronic cases, and 700,000 deaths per year.

The virus is blood-borne, and the most common source of infection is needle-sharing among people who use illicit drugs. In the United States before 1992, when a test became available to screen donated blood, many cases were caused by transfusions. In countries where the blood supply is not screened, transfusions still pose a risk. Needlestick injuries and other hospital accidents may also cause some cases. There is no vaccine to prevent the infection, so treatments have long been eagerly sought. The drugs covered in the new report include two blockbusters, Sovaldi and Harvoni, both made by Gilead Sciences and priced at $1,000 a pill, with billions of dollars in sales. Sovaldi was approved in 2013, and Harvoni in 2014. These drugs and other antivirals can cure the disease in 12 weeks in many patients. Earlier drugs were less effective, had to be taken for much longer and had harsh side effects that left many patients unable to finish the course of therapy. About 250,000 people took the newer drugs in 2015, the report said, at tremendous expense: $55,000 to $125,000 per patient. In those treated during the year ending June 30, 2016, the report identified 524 with liver failure, 165 of whom died. Of those with liver failure, 386 were from outside the United States. An additional 1,058 had severe liver injury, and in 761 the drugs appeared not to work. But whether the drugs were to blame is not known. The problems were observed by doctors who suspected drugs were the cause, but that does not prove cause and effect. And details about the patients' medical histories were not available. A spokesman for Gilead, Mark Snyder, wrote in an email, ""We closely assess both post-marketing safety reports as well as safety data from our clinical trials on an ongoing basis and have found no suggestion of a causal relationship between Sovaldi or Harvoni and liver failure."" He added that Gilead's drugs had been approved for people with severe liver disease from hepatitis C, and that some would inevitably suffer liver failure despite the best treatment.

The F.D.A. received a copy of the report, but declined to discuss it. A spokeswoman, Theresa Eisenman, wrote in an email, ""The F.D.A. does not typically comment on specific studies, but evaluates them as part of the body of evidence to further our understanding about a particular issue and assist in our mission to protect public health."" For all types of drugs, the agency received nearly 300,000 new reports of adverse events during the second quarter of 2016, from the United States and other countries. Most of the events were described by doctors and other health professionals. Because reporting is voluntary for doctors, researchers generally suspect that many problems go unreported and that the real number is higher. In October, the F.D.A. identified the first major safety problem caused by the nine antiviral drugs. In 24 patients, the drugs wiped out hepatitis C -- but also reactivated hepatitis B infections that had been dormant. Two of those patients died, and one needed a liver transplant. The agency said there were probably additional cases that had not been reported. As a result, the agency required that a boxed warning, its most prominent advisory, be added to the labeling of the newer antivirals, telling doctors to screen and monitor for hepatitis B in all patients taking the drugs for hepatitis C. Infection with both viruses is not common, and how the reactivation occurs is not known. The problem was not detected during premarket testing of the drugs because patients who currently had hepatitis B or who had a history of it were not allowed into the studies. With testing and the right treatment, Dr. Brown said, hepatitis B reactivation should be completely preventable. The other cases of liver failure are a separate problem. He said it was important for doctors prescribing the newer drugs to test patients' liver function thoroughly first, because liver disease can be deceptive, and people who look well may actually be on the brink of liver failure and therefore not candidates for the drugs.","Drugs approved in recent years that can cure hepatitis C may have severe side effects, including liver failure, a new report suggests.",5f471e3a-e874-5a21-9615-730d3c2bfaf1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/25/science/24liver3/24liver3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=408068610adc6f821b8a2e58b88ec60b00154e32a12044a00e135da3d253384a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An Egyptian man with hepatitis C recovered after a liver transplant at the National Liver Institute in the Cairo area.,5f471e3a-e874-5a21-9615-730d3c2bfaf1,Demo_data/D1_imgs/15f471e3a-e874-5a21-9615-730d3c2bfaf1.jpg,1,20
Dance,'Alice' in All Its Teenage Subconscious,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/arts/dance/young-romance-is-part-of-wheeldons-wonderland.html,"Just a few years back, it seemed as if evening-length ballets with detailed story lines were a thing of the past, a relic of the pre-postmodern imagination. Athleticism and abstraction were in; plot points and well-defined characters were out. Thus, the announcement, in 2010, that the Royal Ballet, with the National Ballet of Canada, had commissioned Christopher Wheeldon to create a new ballet based on ""Alice in Wonderland"" was greeted with a flurry of interest, and some eye rolling. ""Personally, the idea of a new Alice ballet doesn't make my heart race,"" the dance critic Judith Mackrell wrote in The Guardian. Four years later, after several sold-out runs, the National Ballet of Canada will perform ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, Sept. 9 to 14. Mr. Wheeldon, now 41, spent his early years at the Royal before decamping to New York City Ballet, where he danced for seven years and began his quick rise as a choreographer. (""There was something so liberating about dancing Balanchine and Robbins,"" he said a few weeks ago via Skype from Chicago, where he was preparing to stage his version of ""Swan Lake"" for the Joffrey Ballet. ""Story was what I had escaped from."") His best-known works, like the elegant ""Polyphonia""-- set to strange, beautiful Ligeti piano pieces -- felt more like haikus than novels. The Royal's most recent foray into narrative, a good decade-and-a-half earlier, had not been a success. Even so, Monica Mason -- nearing the end of her directorial tenure -- took the leap. Mr. Wheeldon, in turn, brought the Canadian company on as a partner in what was inevitably an expensive enterprise. ""They're a beautiful company,"" he said, ""a hybrid of the Royal's approach to narrative works and the athleticism"" of American dancers.

The final price tag, almost $2 million, was split down the middle. The ballet had its premiere in London in February 2011 to mixed reviews -- some critics felt there was not enough dancing -- and in Toronto four months later. The Royal took the show to Japan, and the Canadians have brought it to Los Angeles and Washington. The sets sail back and forth. ""I wanted to create a spectacular, like a big Broadway musical without words,"" Mr. Wheeldon explained. The material was familiar and lent itself to a large-scale, colorful treatment. (According to Linda Shelton, the executive director of the Joyce Theater, the organization bringing ""Alice"" to New York, the sets fill nine tractor-trailers.) This ""Alice"" is essentially a sophisticated popular entertainment that combines elements of theater, vaudeville and magic show, with a hint of youthful romance thrown in. The structure was hammered out by the choreographer, the composer Joby Talbot and the playwright Nicholas Wright (acting as dramaturge) over the course of three days spent ""locked up"" -- in Mr. Wheeldon's words -- in his Brooklyn apartment. The opening scene is set at the home of Alice Liddell, the real-life girl who inspired Lewis Carroll's novellas. ""A very early decision,"" Mr. Wright explained via Skype from his study in Notting Hill, in London, ""was to portray it as a sort of unhappy family with an extremely paranoid and dominating mother."" They made Alice slightly older than in the books, 15 or so, old enough to experience a first innocent crush on the gardener's son, Jack. The characters from this scene reappear in Wonderland, transformed. Alice's mother becomes the homicidal Queen of Hearts; Jack resurfaces as the Knave of Hearts. Alice's quest to rescue him from the Queen's clutches is the motor behind her underground adventures.

""It's modern enough that it's interesting and fresh, but at the same time, it keeps those valuable elements of the big Russian scores, and it makes sense physically,"" the National Ballet principal dancer Guillaume Cote said in a phone interview from Toronto. In fact, the choreographer and his composer got on so well that they decided to create another ballet together, ""The Winter's Tale,"" also produced by the Royal and the National Ballet, widely praised when it debuted in London this year. The designer, Bob Crowley, is a veteran of the theater and opera stage with several Tony Awards under his belt. His designs for ""Alice"" blend the whimsy of Carroll -- exotic, hookah-smoking caterpillars and flamingo-headed croquet mallets -- with a love of book illustrations, toy theaters and Victorian confectionary. (Note the wobbling aspic in the first scene.) Clever animations (by John Driscoll) facilitate transitions like Alice's vertiginous descent into Wonderland. Puppetry -- including a dancing puzzle of body parts that magically coalesces into a grinning Cheshire Cat -- adds yet another element of fantasy. The combination of effects manages to be both dazzling and cozy. In this same spirit, Mr. Wheeldon's choreography is playfully classical, blending fanciful passages like a crisp ensemble dance for a pack of playing cards with tongue-in-cheek character dances and swooning pas de deux. There are daft touches, too, like a cracker-jack tap routine for the Mad Hatter, which somehow manages to convey his off-kilter personality in purely dance terms. Balletomanes will be delighted by a smattering of ballet quotations, including a blistering parody of the triumphant ""Rose Adagio"" from ""The Sleeping Beauty."" And, as in the ballets of Frederick Ashton -- an important influence on Mr. Wheeldon -- there's a lot of straight mime. In fact, the dancer who plays Alice is called upon to act (and react) as much as she is to dance. She comes across as plucky, insatiably curious, with a stalwart sense of right and wrong, or, as Mr. Wheeldon put it, as ""a modern take on a Victorian girl.""

For the National Ballet, ""Alice"" has become the ticket to a return to the international scene. Founded in 1951 by the former Sadler's Wells dancer Celia Franca, the company has always had a strong link to the British ballet establishment. Despite an affinity for story ballets -- including works by Ashton, Kenneth MacMillan and John Cranko -- the troupe's repertory also encompasses one-act works by Balanchine and Robbins and more contemporary fare. The visit is the company's first to New York since 2005. David Briskin, the National Ballet's music director, will lead the City Ballet Orchestra. Only one principal, Mr. Cote, is already a familiar face, from recent appearances with American Ballet Theater. In a phone interview, the Canadian company's artistic director, Karen Kain, stressed the importance of the tour to the troupe's international aspirations. But leaving such weighty considerations aside, the ballet is, first of all, meant to entertain. ""Before 'Alice,' I don't think I'd ever had as much fun creating a ballet,"" Mr. Wheeldon said, with a note of disbelief. ""Nor have I since.""","The National Ballet of Canada will perform Christopher Wheeldon's ""Alice"" at David H.

Music,"A Rock Band Flirts With German Taboos, and Finds a Huge Following",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/arts/music/freiwild-germany.html,"NATZ, Italy -- By the time Frei.Wild took the stage at Alpen Flair, a three-day music festival in northern Italy, the sun had disappeared behind the forested peaks of the surrounding Alps. Most of the 20,000 audience members had traveled over 100 miles from Germany to see the band. The crowd was overwhelmingly white and largely male, and many fans shouted along as the band launched into one of its most controversial songs, ""Sudtirol."" The song celebrates Frei.Wild's home region of South Tyrol, where the festival was taking place, a largely German-speaking enclave that was passed to Italy from Austria-Hungary after World War I. ""I won't tolerate any criticism of this sacred land, our homeland,"" the band's heavily tattooed singer, Philipp Burger, sang. An eagle like the one on the region's flag flashed on a large screen onstage.

Frei.Wild (pronounced FRY-vilt) has become one of the most contentious and successful bands in Germany, where its lyrics about loving one's homeland have resonated with people who want to challenge the postwar taboo against public expressions of national pride. The band sings in German, and its music is a punk-inflected variant of ""deutschrock,"" a form of German rock music. But a South Tyrolean identity allows the group to voice nationalist sentiments in German, for a largely German audience, while partly avoiding the backlash that a German band would encounter for making similar statements.

With songs like ""Sudtirol"" and ""Land der Vollidioten"" (""Land of Complete Idiots""), which rails against the removal of crosses from schools out of respect for non-Christian children, critics in Germany have argued the band helps to foster anti-immigrant sentiment and right-wing nationalism. The musicians argue they are merely singing about their personal experiences, and that their reputation as a far-right band is a media distortion. In one song, ""Wahre Werte,"" or ""True Values,"" Mr. Burger sings that ""language, traditions and religion are the values of the homeland/Without them we will go under."" In an interview, Mr. Burger said he had titled one recent song ""Antiwillkommen"" (""Anti-Welcome"") to be provocative. After Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to allow large numbers of refugees to come to Germany in 2015, the government encouraged a ""willkommenskultur,"" or ""culture of welcoming.""

Peter Soder, 52, and his wife, Claudia, 44, traveled to South Tyrol from the southern German state of Baden-Wurttemberg to see the band at Alpen Flair. ""Frei.Wild isn't just entertainment and fun, it's also political,"" Mr. Soder said. ""The lyrics capture the zeitgeist in Germany,"" he said. Smoking a cigarette in the festival's backstage area, Mr. Burger recounted how he and three acquaintances -- Christian Fohrer, Jochen Gargitter and Jonas Notdurfter -- formed the band in 2001, inspired by the Ramones, Guns N' Roses and Bohse Onkelz, a German rock group that has also been accused of extreme right-wing sympathies. As a teenager, Mr. Burger sang in a neo-Nazi band called Kaiserjager -- a decision he now describes as a ""mistake."" Although all of Frei.Wild's members live in or around Brixen, Italy, a picturesque town near the Austrian border, they gradually built an audience by playing in clubs and festivals in Germany. Mr. Burger explained that the band focused on Germany because it has a much larger market for German-language music than Italy. With their message of taking pride in one's homeland, the band was able to appeal to nationalists in both countries -- as well as in Austria and Switzerland. The group's success has been met with outrage from musicians, activists and politicians in Germany. In 2012, a journalist accused Frei.Wild on a TV talk show of acting like a neo-Nazi band, setting off a wider discussion about the band's ideological position. When the band was nominated the following year for an Echo Prize, the German equivalent of the Grammys, other acts threatened to boycott the ceremony and the nomination was rescinded.

Mr. Burger argued that the band's reputation as a right-wing populist act was largely a creation of the media, which misrepresents and misconstrues his lyrics. The singer, who sports a severe undercut and speaks with a husky rasp, said that most of the band's songs were personal expressions of ""fears, hopes, disappointments, feelings of thankfulness to my family, and about South Tyrol."" Sven-Christian Kindler, a German lawmaker who was attacked by a right-wing extremist in 2014 after he spoke against Frei.Wild's lyrics, argued in a telephone interview that Mr. Burger deliberately used ambiguous codes to appeal to far-right fans. ""It's the classical strategy of right-wing radicals,"" said Mr. Kindler, a member of the Greens. As an example, he pointed to the song ""Gutmenschen und Moralapostel"" (""Do-Gooders and Moralizers""), which complains about the ""supermen of the century,"" who have decided that ""people should hate themselves/Just so history, which brings in money, isn't put to rest."" Mr. Kindler described the lyrics as ""anti-Semitic codes."" In an email, Mr. Burger said that Mr. Kindler's accusation was ""dumb, malicious, wrong,"" and that the lyrics were in fact about ""warmongers, corporate emperors,"" politicians and ""media agitators."" He also argued that the band was pro-Israel, has Jewish fans and has visited Israel many times. Mr. Kindler said that Frei.Wild fit into the strategy outlined by the ""New Right,"" a loose movement of political intellectuals in Germany that believes right-wingers need to establish a ""cultural hegemony"" in order to bring their politics into the mainstream. The band, he said, ""is bringing a racist, xenophobic, nationalist, ethnic thinking into the heads of young people through their music.""

Thorsten Hindrichs, a musicologist at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, said in a telephone interview that Frei.Wild had become a rallying point for right-wing populists in a German music landscape that has overwhelmingly positioned itself as ""liberal and anti-fascist."" ""Music articulates the interior psychological state of a society,"" he said, adding, ""Frei.Wild articulates a repertoire of opinions that is no longer a rarity in Germany."" Back at Alpen Flair, Katja Merz, a 19-year-old from the German state of Hesse, said she was drawn to Frei.Wild by the fact that it has ""a song for every emotion -- love, pain, happiness."" She said she sometimes argued with friends and strangers about the band's politics, but that she was convinced that Mr. Burger had left his neo-Nazi politics behind him. Other visitors, including a family with three generations of Frei.Wild fans, said they had attended the festival merely because they enjoyed listening to rock music with German lyrics. Some attendees saw the band's appeal in more ideological terms. Bernhard Pahleng, 47, a customer service representative from the Black Forest region of southern Germany, said he welcomed Frei.Wild's politics, which he said appealed to people who were ""sick of being ashamed of being German."" He said the band was part of a patriotic German countermovement to the refugee crisis, which he believed might have been caused by a conspiracy of outsiders -- including Jews ""who hold the strings"" in the United States -- to keep Germany from being economically successful. ""In any case,"" he said of the band, ""it's a big wave they are making.""",Frei.Wild has become one of the most popular bands in Germany.

Science,Growing Pains for Field of Epigenetics as Some Call for Overhaul,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/science/epigenetic-marks-dna-genes.html,"Growing Pains for Field of Epigenetics as Some Call for Overhaul

Our genes are not just naked stretches of DNA. They're coiled into intricate three-dimensional tangles, their lengths decorated with tiny molecular ""caps."" These so-called epigenetic marks are crucial to the workings of the genome: They can silence some genes and activate others. Epigenetic marks are crucial for our development. Among other functions, they direct a single egg to produce the many cell types, including blood and brain cells, in our bodies. But some high-profile studies have recently suggested something more: that the environment can change your epigenetic marks later in life, and that those changes can have long-lasting effects on health. In May, Duke University researchers claimed that epigenetics could explain why people who grow up poor are at greater risk of depression as adults. Even more provocative studies suggest that when epigenetic marks change, people can pass them to their children, reprogramming their genes. But criticism of these studies has been growing. Some researchers argue that the experiments have been weakly designed: Very often, they say, it's impossible for scientists to confirm that epigenetics is responsible for the effects they see.

Three prominent researchers recently outlined their skepticism in detail in the journal PLoS Genetics. The field, they say, needs an overhaul. ""We need to get drunk, go home, have a bit of a cry, and then do something about it tomorrow,"" said John M. Greally, one of the authors and an epigenetics expert at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Among other criticisms, he and his co-authors -- Ewan Birney of the European Bioinformatics Institute and George Davey Smith of the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol in England -- argue that in some cases, changes to epigenetic marks don't cause disease, but are merely consequences of disease. Some studies, for example, have found that people with a high body mass index have unusual epigenetic marks on a gene called HIF3A. Some researchers have suggested that those marks change how HIF3A functions, perhaps reprogramming fat cells to store more fat. If that were true, then drugs that reverse these changes might be able to help obese people lose weight. But Dr. Smith and his colleagues have found that overweight subjects experienced epigenetic changes to HIF3A only after they put on weight.

James M. Flanagan, a senior lecturer at Imperial College London, agreed with Dr. Smith and his co-authors that tracking epigenetic changes over time can be revealing. ""It's the best way to go about it,"" he said. But these experiments are especially hard to set up, he noted, because scientists have to gather blood or other genetic samples from healthy people and then wait years for some of them to get sick. In other cases, apparent changes in epigenetic marks may actually be the result of different kinds of cells becoming more or less common in people, Dr. Greally and his colleagues also warned. ""That's where things get hairy,"" Dr. Greally said. Smoking, for example, triggers a boom in immature blood cells, which carry epigenetic marks different from those of other cell types in the blood. Rafael A. Irizarry, an applied statistician at Dana-Farber Cancer Center and the Harvard School of Public Health, said new methods could help researchers steer clear of this confusion. Scientists can sort cells into different types before looking at their epigenetic marks, he said. It's even becoming possible to look at the epigenetics of one cell at a time.

""But it makes the process way more expensive,"" Dr. Irizarry said. Dr. Greally and his colleagues note another source of confusion: Normal genetic variation leads some people to produce different epigenetic marks than others. If researchers were to find that alcoholics carry an unusual epigenetic mark, for instance, that wouldn't necessarily mean that it resulted from heavy drinking. These people may have a genetic variation that puts them at risk of alcoholism and, perhaps coincidentally, creates an unusual epigenetic mark on their DNA. Dr. Greally said these possibilities have been neglected because scientists have been so captivated by the idea that epigenetic marks can reprogram cells. ""Since you don't talk about anything else, you interpret the results solely through that little sliver of possibility,"" he said. He and his colleagues go so far as to claim that no published results on the links between epigenetic marks and disease ""can be said to be fully interpretable."" Other experts feel that such an indictment is a bit too broad. Dr. Flanagan pointed to several recent studies in which scientists confronted the very challenges that Dr. Greally and his colleagues wrote about. Last year, for example, a team of European scientists investigated how smoking causes lung cancer. They took advantage of large-scale studies in Australia, Norway and Sweden that collected blood from tens of thousands of people and tracked their health for years. The scientists found that smokers who got lung cancer tended to lose the same epigenetic marks on a pair of genes.","Studies of so-called epigenetic marks, crucial to our development, have met with growing skepticism over their findings.",44c1a1fa-bd53-512a-9bef-c81b553f985d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/02/science/02MATTER/02MATTER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=fb4aefdc23700152d7725491d7c438e2a912b1a5d12cb11becc7a4f88c5098e0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An artist's representation of epigenetics, which describes modifications to the genome that can be passed on to future cells.

Opinion,We Are Not Done With Abolition,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/opinion/abolition-prison-labor-amendement.html,"Mr. Foner is the author of "" The Second Founding : How the Civil War and Reconstruction Remade the Constitution.""





Early this month, a group of Democratic members of Congress introduced an Abolition Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Why, in the year 2020, does the Constitution need an amendment dealing with the abolition of slavery? Wasn't that accomplished over a century and a half ago? The problem is that the Thirteenth Amendment, ratified in 1865, which prohibits slavery throughout the country, allows for ""involuntary servitude"" as a ""punishment for crime."" This loophole made possible the establishment of a giant, extremely profitable, system of convict labor, mainly affecting African-Americans, in the Jim Crow South. That system no longer exists but its legacy remains in the widespread forced labor of prisoners, who are paid far below the minimum wage. The Abolition Amendment would eliminate the Thirteenth Amendment's ""criminal exemption"" by adding these words to the Constitution: ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude may be imposed as a punishment for a crime."" When enacted, the Thirteenth Amendment was recognized as a turning point in the history of the United States, indeed the entire world. When the House of Representatives approved it as the Civil War drew to a close, wild scenes of celebration followed. Members threw their hats in the air and embraced one another. Passage, wrote one newspaper, was ""the crowning event of the war, indeed of the century."" The Amendment's wording, including the criminal exemption, was based on Thomas Jefferson's proposed but never enacted Land Ordinance of 1784, which would have barred slavery in all the new nation's territories. From there, it migrated to the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which prohibited slavery in territories north of the Ohio River. Scholars have not explained why Jefferson devised this language. Perhaps he thought that labor was good for the character and would aid in the rehabilitation of prisoners. But the coupling of a ban on slavery with an exemption for convicted criminals quickly became embedded in American law. By the time of the Civil War, it could be found in the constitutions of a large majority of the free states. Such language survives in nearly half the state constitutions.

During the 1850s, Republicans, including Abraham Lincoln, popularized the claim that the Northwest Ordinance demonstrated that their new party was following the intentions of the founding fathers when it sought to bar slavery from the western territories. When it came time during the Civil War to write an amendment abolishing slavery, Charles Sumner, the abolitionist Senator from Massachusetts, proposed wording based on the 1791 French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. His colleague Jacob Howard of Michigan rejected the idea of using a French model. ""Good old Anglo-Saxon language"" was adequate, he declared, and Congress gravitated to the wording of Jefferson's ordinance. Because of its very familiarity, the text of the Thirteenth Amendment did not undergo necessary scrutiny. The criminal exemption was almost never mentioned in congressional debates, contemporary newspapers or at antislavery conventions that endorsed the proposed amendment. But the clause did not go unnoticed by white Southerners. The all-white governments established in the South by President Andrew Johnson after the war's end enacted laws known as the Black Codes, which sought to use the courts to consign African-Americans to involuntary labor. Black Americans who failed to sign a contract to work for a white employer could be convicted of vagrancy, fined and, if unable to pay, sold at public auction. ""Cunning rebels,"" one congressman complained in 1866, were using ""the exceptional clause"" to reduce freed persons to slavery. In 1867, the National Anti-Slavery Standard, an abolitionist journal published in New York City, called for the passage of a new amendment eliminating the words ""except as a punishment for crime."" Today's abolition amendment seeks to accomplish the same result by other means. Also in 1867, a Republican congressman from Iowa, John A. Kasson, introduced a resolution clarifying the ""true intent"" of the 13th Amendment. It was not meant, he insisted, to authorize the ""sale or other disposition"" of people convicted of crime. If prisoners were required to labor, this should be under the supervision of public authorities, not private individuals or companies. The resolution passed the House, but did not come to a vote in the Senate.

By this time, Congress had enacted, over Johnson's veto, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which mandated racial equality in judicial punishments, and had approved the 14th Amendment, requiring states to provide to all people the ""equal protection of the laws."" These, senators thought, would prevent the use of the courts to victimize African-Americans, rendering Kasson's resolution unnecessary. Time would prove them tragically wrong. During Radical Reconstruction, when hundreds of thousands of African-Americans voted for the first time and large numbers held public office, racial bias in the criminal justice system and the forced labor of those convicted of crime remained minor problems. There were hardly any prisons or prisoners in the South. But with the overthrow of Reconstruction and the imposition of the comprehensive system of white supremacy known as Jim Crow, the prison population expanded rapidly. Southern states filled their jails with African-Americans, often former slaves convicted of minor crimes. They then rented them out as labor for the owners of railroads, plantations and factories, or required them to work on chain gangs building roads and other public projects, or inside prison walls for private businesses. The labor of prisoners became a significant source of revenue for Southern states. The system also took hold, but in a much smaller way, in the North. Without violating the 13th Amendment, Republicans in post-Reconstruction Texas complained, ""the courts of law are employed to re-enslave the colored race."" Plantations, they added, ""are worked, as of old, by slaves, under the name of convicts."" Conditions were barbarous and the supply of convicts seemingly endless. ""One dies, get another,"" became a popular refrain among those who profited from the labor of prisoners.

With the expansion of private prisons, more and more inmates work for private contractors, sometimes in factory settings within prison walls. In recent years, many companies have used or benefited from the labor of prisoners. As late as the 1980s, the Department of Justice concluded that the 13th Amendment attaches ""some of the characteristics of slavery"" to prisoners, including exemption from minimum-wage laws. Indeed, courts have ruled that inmates working in prisons have no constitutional right to payment at all. A few years ago, the documentary film ""13th"" linked the origin of today's racially biased mass incarceration to the criminal exemption clause. But the members of Congress who voted on the 13th Amendment did not anticipate the later emergence of a new system of involuntary servitude in the South. We hear a great deal in judicial circles about the ""original intent"" or ""original meaning"" of constitutional provisions. But the 13th Amendment shows that unanticipated consequences can be as significant as intended ones. The amendment, which destroyed the largest slave system the modern world has known, was deservedly an occasion for celebration. Especially given our heightened awareness of the inequities of our criminal justice system, it is high time the criminal exemption was eliminated, as the abolition amendment proposes. Like any change in the Constitution, the abolition amendment would need the approval of two-thirds of Congress and three-quarters of the states, a daunting requirement. It is certain to encounter resistance from those who profit from prison labor, now a multibillion-dollar industry, as well as those who deem unpaid labor a just punishment. But approval would recognize the basic human rights of those convicted of crime. Reinforcing the idea that all people who work should be paid for their labor, it would be a major step in bringing to fruition the ""new birth of freedom"" promised by the Civil War.

Movies,'The Real Right Stuff' Review: A Movie Still Waiting for Liftoff,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/movies/the-real-right-stuff-review.html,"Tom Jennings's documentary ""The Real Right Stuff,"" produced by National Geographic and streaming on Disney+, hammers the unruliness back under the hood. Alan Shepard's philandering, for example, is polished to a quick mention of his appetite for ""cookies,"" as the astronauts' female fans were nicknamed, over shots of women boating Cocoa Beach in modest swimsuits, as though all involved parties were merely hot for wholesome fun in the sun. With the meaty Mercury 7 gossip cleaved to Disney+'s concurrent fictionalized series, ""The Right Stuff,"" the documentary is a bland chronology of successful launches and minor mishaps, constructed from scraps of archival newscasts, home videos and book excerpts read by Wolfe himself. The only dissonant note is from the synthetic, heavy-panting score, which seems anxious that an alien might -- just might! -- decide to cling to the heat shield.

Sixty years have not dimmed the Mercury crew's courageous, telegenic appeal. In another life, the dimpled John Glenn could have poached James Cagney's career of playing bruiser priests and boxers with a heart of gold. Alas, the film's polished heroics let the astronauts' humanity whiz by out of reach. Instead, it's the anonymous spectators who shoulder the film's emotional power. These lesser mortals are constrained by gravity and fate to remain on the ground. Yet, the heart swells to see a crowd united in celebration of an America that delivered on a sky-high scientific ambition.

Books,Vagabond Lives: Happier Memories From Kathryn Harrison's Childhood,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/books/review/kathryn-harrison-on-sunset.html,"""The Kiss"" landed in 1997, an early example of the dark-cornered memoirs that would dominate publishing for the next two decades, paving the way for the gimlet-eyed investigations of Rachel Cusk and the wincing beauty of Edward St. Aubyn's Patrick Melrose novels. At the time, there was much hand-wringing over the suggestion that the price of entry into this new/old publishing niche wasn't writerly chops but childhood abuse. It's also hard to fathom, in these #MeToo days, how much opprobrium was hurled at Harrison, in particular, for publicly unfurling her gnarled history, as if she were complicit in her father's crime. But with detachment and grace, Harrison, along with Mary Karr and Tobias Wolff, her literary compadres from that era, more than earned her right to revisit that territory.

And so to ""On Sunset,"" which describes not just a place (a house built on a precarious site) but the period into which Harrison was born. Her grandparents met late in life, and a daughter and granddaughter were ""the not unhappy surprises,"" as her grandfather tells Harrison, of that autumn union. Her grandfather was 50 and a traveling salesman. Her grandmother was 41 and had bucketed around the world -- the last stops before Los Angeles were London and the French Riviera -- as her family's fortunes waxed and waned, pursued by fortune hunters and energized by her passion for, among other things, fast cars. (Settling in Los Angeles, she brought her flair for speed and disregard for speed limits with her. ""What tosh,"" she exclaimed with typical insouciance when she failed a written driving test.)

She was a Sassoon, a member of an enormous merchant family from Baghdad known as the Rothschilds of the East. By the late 19th century, Harrison writes, they were responsible for 70 percent of the world's opium trade. Florid eccentricity was a family trait. Harrison's great-aunt Cecily was a lesbian who lived with not one but two lovers, all three in one bed. A visit from Cecily, accompanied by one of her inamoratas, riveted Harrison: The couple dressed alike in black, shared a single seat at the dinner table and ate from a single plate. Cousin George lived at the Plaza Athenee in Paris with his mother and at midcentury socialized with otherworldly characters like Gore Vidal, Jean Genet and David Niven. At 80, George is ""your fairy godmother, sweetie pie,"" he tells Harrison, and gives her a photograph of himself sporting angel wings and nothing else.

Harrison's grandfather came from humbler stock -- his mother ran a boardinghouse after her fishmonger husband died of consumption, and he was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker at 14 -- but he was as happily afflicted with wanderlust as her grandmother. As a child, Harrison delighted in naming the many New World cities, from Quebec City to Juneau, that he stopped to work in as an engineer or a timekeeper or an accountant. At home on Sunset Boulevard, he wore dress suits and white shirts when gardening. (He never bought new clothes, having a full wardrobe left over from the sample cases of his life as a traveling salesman.) He was gentle, handy and resourceful, tending a vegetable garden, planting succulents to shore up the eroding cliffside property, building a chair high in a tree so Harrison could read ""Alice in Wonderland"" among the branches.","Her previous memoirs delved into her parents' traumatic influence. Now, in ""On Sunset,"" she introduces the beloved Old World grandparents who raised her.",19cec405-ceff-5666-8bdd-0264ae5a58b1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/04/books/review/04green1/04green1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=c0eb1f3f021595aa84679018bb327bd74c7c08f74fb581b48d43423929a44cdf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kathryn Harrison in Scripps Park, La Jolla, 1969.",19cec405-ceff-5666-8bdd-0264ae5a58b1,Demo_data/D1_imgs/119cec405-ceff-5666-8bdd-0264ae5a58b1.jpg,13,4
Automobiles,Federal Regulators Investigate Chrysler Over Speed of Recall Repairs,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/automobiles/federal-regulators-investigate-chrysler-over-speed-of-recall-repairs.html,"Federal regulators are investigating whether Chrysler is acting quickly enough to recall almost one million pickup trucks over a steering system defect. It is the second time this year the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has questioned the automaker over its promptness in repairing safety defects.

The action involves two recalls issued late last year because a steering part had the potential to fail. The safety agency says it has received ""hundreds of complaints from owners reporting frustrations with obtaining service appointments and having their vehicles remedied,"" according to a report posted on the agency's website.

Some owners said they lost control of their trucks when the defective part failed.

""Had been waiting over six months for parts from dealership to repair the left tie rod recall,"" one owner wrote to the agency on Oct. 6. ""Upon leaving a gas station and accelerating to proceed down the highway, the left tie rod broke, causing the vehicle's left wheel to lock, resulting in total loss of control. The vehicle crossed over to the right shoulder, landing partially in a ditch. Luckily there was no traffic next to me and no one was injured.""

At the time the recall was issued, Chrysler said it would recall more vehicles than likely had the defect to make sure they found all the ones with the bad steering part. The vehicles covered by the recall were about 842,000 Ram 2500 and 3500 heavy-duty pickups from the 2003-8 model years, of which Chrysler estimated that 116,000 would require repairs, a294,000 Ram 2500 and 3500 pickups and chassis cabs from the 2008-12 model years and 2008 Ram 1500 4x4 Mega Cabs, all of which require repairs. Also, about 43,500 Ram 4500 and 5500 4-wheel drive chassis cab trucks from the 2008-12 model years are being recalled, all of which require repairs.",N.H.T.S.A. has received complaints that repairs have not been made to Ram pickups recalled last year; Suzuki and G.M. issue recalls.,6eca390d-b99e-5f17-8c79-fb1605416f36,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/automobiles/01RECALLS-image/01RECALLS-image-articleLarge.png?year=2014&h=330&w=600&s=0bfd347a15117c9dafac0e9da27b3a7b44672c9862eb7e5ca631f2232062a1c2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The 2012 Ram 3500.,6eca390d-b99e-5f17-8c79-fb1605416f36,Demo_data/D1_imgs/16eca390d-b99e-5f17-8c79-fb1605416f36.jpg,23,23
Music,"Review: Cool and Subdued, a Pianist Saves Debussy From Cliché",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/arts/music/review-stephen-hough-debussy-carnegie.html,"What was the pianist Stephen Hough doing opening his Carnegie Hall recital on Tuesday, honoring the 100th anniversary of Debussy's death, with ""Clair de lune""? The piece has been so overplayed that's it's almost past cliche.

Why not do the full work from which it's drawn, Debussy's early ""Suite Bergamasque,"" which you don't often hear? And what were Schumann's formidable Fantasy in C and Beethoven's stormy ""Appassionata"" Sonata doing on a recital dedicated to Debussy, who didn't have much interest in either composer?

Well, the adventurous Mr. Hough, who is also a composer, knew just what he was up to. His subdued account of ""Clair de lune"" set a contemplative mood in the hall. I think Mr. Hough was also sending another message: Don't assume anything about Debussy; even this popular early piece reveals a radical in the making. Mr. Hough conveyed the exploratory elements of ""Clair de lune"" by playing it with rhythmic integrity and not a trace of expressive milking. He emphasized the halting flow of the ethereal melody, which unfolds in abrupt phrases that keep stopping momentarily to let a plush harmony linger.",Stephen Hough's program at Carnegie Hall seemed a curious way of honoring the 100th anniversary of a composer's death.

Automobiles,"Reality Check From Honda, in Touch With Economics",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/automobiles/autoreviews/reality-check-from-honda-in-touch-with-economics.html,"NO one would blame you for interpreting Honda's introduction of the 2012 NC700X as an attempt to bring some sanity back to motorcycling. This model is, in many ways, the ""not"" bike: not a 175-horsepower sports machine, not a radically stretched cruiser, not some full-boat cross-continent touring rig. Instead, the new Honda -- new to the United States, that is, it is already on sale in Europe -- is aimed at the mainstream, no apology offered. Sure, Honda lists it as an adventure-class entry, but Cycle World magazine's recent naming of the NC700X as its Best Standard motorcycle for 2012 is probably a better indicator of the bike's true mission. It is a tempting choice for riders who want versatility -- and don't need scare-you-to-death speed. Terrific fuel economy tops a long list of attributes that includes clever storage options, stable handling and a price that starts at a reasonable $7,309, including destination charges. Honda will offer a wide range of accessories to elevate what is essentially a no-frills bike in its basic form to one that is suitable for touring and adventure trekking.

My test of the NC700X started at the arrivals area of the airport here on a day when the forecast of zero percent chance of rain turned into a deluge. The stock windscreen, less protective than the proverbial fig leaf, provided little cover (a taller and wider screen is a $170 option). The rest of the bike performed flawlessly over hundreds of miles of wet pavement. The suspension's 5.4 inches of front fork travel, and 5.9 inches at the rear from its single-shock Pro-Link layout proved more than adequate for coping with California's deepening array of potholes. I expected a blowout, but the tires put up a good fight against California's excessively grooved concrete freeways. What really helped most in the wet, however, was not having an excess of power -- none of that pesky wheelspin. That's right: I'm extolling the virtues here of a rather pokey bike. Honda said its research showed 90 percent of all motorcycle riders travel at speeds of 85 m.p.h. or less. So, that is where it placed the ceiling of the NC700X's sweet spot of performance for a global market. The NC700X can exceed 85, but time is needed to build up to that momentum. Even when run nearly wide open all the time, the bike's stellar fuel mileage seemed to hold up. Honda says 64 m.p.g. fuel economy is achievable in everyday riding, but more -- sometimes much more -- is attainable.

On my four-hour ride from Long Beach to Las Vegas, I stopped hourly to top off the 3.7-gallon tank and assess the mileage. From sea level to roughly 4,000 feet in the Cajon Pass on Interstate 15, I recorded 61 m.p.g. I considered that impressive, as it was uphill much of the way, and I wasn't sure the tank was full when I picked up the bike. For the next hour, across the Mojave Desert, the bike averaged 70 m.p.g. For the final two hours, over four mountain passes, the NC700X managed 72 m.p.g. (A tail wind may have helped.) Undoubtedly, riding at a lower average speed, with more prudent throttle use, would have produced even gaudier numbers. On a wide array of motorcycles, ridden along the same test route over the course of several years, I've seldom observed fuel economy of more than 50 m.p.g. Something around 40 m.p.g. is more the norm. The Honda's result is all the more impressive because of its heft. At 474 pounds, it is no lightweight for a bike with two cylinders. The NC700X is powered by a fuel-injected parallel twin that lays its cylinders forward at a 62-degree angle rather than placing them nearly upright. The undersquare design of the engine -- its 670 cc displacement is the result of a 73-millimeter bore and an 80-millimeter stroke -- helps assure a smooth delivery of torque, which peaks at a very low 4,750 r.p.m. Cost savings were realized by the use of branched passages for the intake and exhaust: only one throttle body and one catalytic converter is needed to serve both cylinders. The placement of the cylinders, along with design possibilities opened up by a new steel trellis frame, offered plenty of space for a handy lockable storage compartment where the gas tank would normally be. It is large enough to fit a full-face helmet or backpack. (The fuel filler is in a small storage area atop the rear wheel.) When outfitted with hard bags and a trunk -- also options offered by Honda -- the NC700X can be a real pack mule. Adding that equipment is not cheap, though, taking the bike beyond the $10,000 level when fully loaded. Two-up touring is possible, but the bike seems a bit small for that. No doubt Honda or an aftermarket supplier will offer a more comfortable seat -- the stock cushion is hard as a park bench, and would be a pretty miserable perch if one tried to sit through the bike's full 250-mile fuel range.","The Honda 2012 NC700X is aimed at the mainstream, no apology offered.

Global Business,"Amid Economic Stress, Differing Strategies Emerge",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/business/global/indonesia-needs-to-wean-itself-from-easy-money-leader-says.html,"JAKARTA -- Indonesia and India, the two emerging markets hardest hit in recent weeks by falling currencies and other financial troubles, took opposite tracks on Friday as both countries struggled to balance growth with the threat of inflation. In an interview here, the vice president of Indonesia characterized higher interest rates and a weakened currency as the ""new normal."" Boediono, the country's vice president, who uses only one name, said that Indonesia would face a tougher international financial environment in the coming months and should give greater emphasis to a stable currency, stable prices and a stable trade balance and not just pursue economic growth. ""We have been addicted, so to speak, with an easy-money environment for four years,"" said Mr. Boediono, the main architect of Indonesian economic policy since the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998. ""We know that we have to make some adjustments, and maybe by next year, we have to really, fully adjust to a new normal, so to speak, where easy money is no longer"" available. But in Mumbai, the new governor of the Reserve Bank of India suggested that India faced less of an international threat after the Federal Reserve decided on Wednesday to continue its economic stimulus, at least temporarily. The governor, Raghuram Rajan, lowered a key interest rate on Friday by three-quarters of a percent, although he raised another less important rate by a quarter of a percent.

India pushed interest rates up sharply over the summer to make financial investments there more attractive and slow the fall of the rupee. Reversing part of that increase now ""will provide a boost to growth, reduce the financing distortions that are emerging in the market, and reduce the strain on corporate and bank balance sheets,"" Raghuram Rajan, the new governor, said Friday at his first news conference on monetary policy. In monetary terms, India is zigging while Indonesia is zagging, despite the many common challenges that have pummeled their currencies and stock markets in recent weeks. Both must balance a need to preserve economic growth for large, heavily poor populations, while at the same time preventing a buildup of inflation that might discourage longer-term investments -- a tricky balancing act that has bedeviled policy makers in the United States and other affluent countries over the years. India, with a population of about 1.2 billion, and Indonesia, population 250 million, are both struggling to modernize their infrastructure while stuck with complex land ownership laws that make it hard to redevelop cities rapidly. Both are wrestling with costly but politically popular fuel subsidies that are driving up government budget deficits, and both have indignant publics demanding an end to endemic corruption. Economically, both have sizable current-account deficits compared to their economic output, together with nearly double-digit inflation in consumer prices. Perhaps most important, both face national elections next year that limit their ability to make politically unappetizing economic decisions: India will elect a new Parliament by the end of May, while Indonesia will elect a new legislature in April and a new president in July.

While Indonesia's ports and highways still have shortcomings, as does the country's bureaucracy, they are good enough that the country has emerged as one destination for the many companies shifting operations away from China in response to surging blue-collar wages there. India's bureaucracy remains stifling, and the potholes and traffic on the country's roads are so bad that vehicles scarcely move faster than walking speed in some areas; in other areas, sometime gruesome crashes are a regular occurrence. Above all, India's is the more fractious democracy. Indonesia gave political independence to its central bank in 1999, right after the Asian financial crisis. The Bank of Indonesia raised short-term interest rates last week, but the country's business community remains supportive -- Sofjan Wanandi, the influential tycoon who is the chairman of the Employers' Association of Indonesia, said in an interview this week that business leaders were ready to pay even higher interest rates as needed to control inflation.
* Open or closed on Thanksgiving? Here are stores' plans for Thursday and Friday. By contrast, the Reserve Bank of India is subject to the dictates of the government. The Confederation of Indian Industry, the country's most powerful business group, representing the large companies that tend to receive most of Indian bank loans, has been lobbying heavily in recent weeks for a full cut of one percentage point in lending rates. Emerging markets around the world have seen an exodus of investment, falling currencies and tumbling stock markets since May. That was when the Fed began signaling that it was preparing to start cutting back its purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities -- purchases that had helped keep long-term interest rates low. Vice President Boediono of Indonesia, a former finance minister and governor of the central bank, said Friday that the Fed's decision on Wednesday to defer a reduction in economic stimulus offers Indonesia a breathing space but does not remove the necessity for prompt action by policy makers here.

While avoiding specifics, Mr. Boediono appeared to hint that he did not expect recent market shifts to be reversed quickly. He said that Indonesia had to adjust ""interest rates, even our exchange rate, to a new normal."" He called for a series of supply-side measures to address bottlenecks in the economy that could fuel inflation. These measures included easier land acquisition and permits for infrastructure projects as well as a new system of online education that would span Indonesia's huge archipelago, which stretches a similar distance as Seattle to Tampa. ""Work hard on the supply side, then you can achieve a safe level of inflation without having to really tighten your monetary policy with the costs to growth and so on,"" he said. President Xi Jinping of China is scheduled to come to Jakarta next week. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia will hold discussions with him on some issues, including the South China Sea, Mr. Boediono said, declining to elaborate. Mr. Boediono said that he would discuss with President Xi the possibility of expanding the bilateral swap agreement between the two countries, but said that the amount of the expansion had not yet been decided. An expanded agreement would allow Indonesia to borrow more dollars from China if needed to buy rupiah in currency markets someday during another period of exchange rate volatility. Mr. Boediono was elected vice president in the summer of 2009 when President Yudhoyono won a second term. Legislative elections are scheduled for next April and presidential elections for next July; President Yudhoyono is not running for a third five-year term because of term limits. As a technocrat with a limited political base, Mr. Boediono has not been expected to run for president. He said on Friday that he had no desire for public office after his term ends in October next year and hoped to focus on online education thereafter.","Indonesia must get used to higher interest rates, its vice president said Friday, while India's central bank decided it needed to lower its rates.",5e437e05-7297-5216-b04f-430501d69a1e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/21/business/21rupiah-tofu/21rupiah-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=2c4542e36b234091a8ada61742883d366cb72d818d0e6b20cdda66e011ef7b62&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A tofu factory this month in Banda Aceh, Indonesia.",5e437e05-7297-5216-b04f-430501d69a1e,Demo_data/D1_imgs/15e437e05-7297-5216-b04f-430501d69a1e.jpg,24,8
Technology,Trump Spread Multiple Conspiracy Theories on Monday. Here Are Their Roots.,https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-conspiracy-theories.html,"[Follow our live coverage of the Biden inauguration.]

In a wide-ranging interview with the Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Monday night, President Trump spread multiple conspiracy theories about the protests that have erupted across the nation. Many of his unfounded claims can be traced back to narratives that have been swirling online for months.

Here are three of the baseless conspiracy theories that Mr. Trump spread and where they came from.

A plane 'loaded with thugs' headed to the Republican convention.

During the interview with Ms. Ingraham, Mr. Trump claimed that ""we had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend, and in the plane it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that.""

Mr. Trump then alleged that the people were headed to Washington, D.C., to disrupt the Republican National Convention.

There is no evidence of a flight matching Mr. Trump's description. But the claim is similar to a baseless allegation that appeared online as early as June, when a wave of cities and towns became alarmed by unsubstantiated rumors that the loose collective of anti-fascist activists known as antifa was being sent into their communities to disrupt the peace.",The unfounded ideas have been circulating online for months.,f66474d8-062a-50b1-8267-f45bdc7b0641,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/01/business/01trumpconspiracy/01trumpconspiracy-facebookJumbo.jpg,A screenshot from Laura Ingraham's interview with President Trump on Fox News on Monday.,f66474d8-062a-50b1-8267-f45bdc7b0641,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1f66474d8-062a-50b1-8267-f45bdc7b0641.jpg,20,20
Science,Black Rhinos Roam Chad for the First Time in 46 Years,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/science/rhinos-africa-extinction.html,"A critically endangered black rhinoceros was released upon arriving at Zakouma National Park in Chad.

Black Rhinos Roam Chad for the First Time in 46 Years

Pigs don't fly yet, but rhinos do. Six black rhinoceroses were flown from South Africa to Zakouma National Park in Chad last week, reuniting the threatened animal with a land it has not roamed in nearly five decades. Chad is one of several African countries that have recently sought to start their own small black rhino populations in an attempt to protect the species from extinction. It is a participant in the African Rhino Conservation Plan, which hopes to significantly grow the number of rhinos in Africa over the next five years.

Veterinarians in South Africa began training the six rhinos three months ago to prepare them for the trip, said Janine Raftopoulos, head of corporate communications for South African National Parks. The handlers kept the rhinos in bomas, or small enclosures, so they would be accustomed to spending time in confined spaces. The rhinos were sedated for the flight and accompanied by support staff and veterinarians. They were closely monitored throughout the trip to Chad.

Up until the mid-20th century, black rhinos dominated the landscape of Chad, grazing and attracting tourists. But they also attracted poachers, who hunted them for their horns, which are coveted for traditional Chinese medicinal practices and are displayed as status symbols. The population of black rhinos is down 97.6 percent since 1960. Some estimate that as few as 5,500 are left on the continent, according to the African Wildlife Foundation.

""That Zakouma National Park in Chad is considered sufficiently secure for a new rhino population is to be welcomed,"" she said. According to the African Wildlife Foundation, 98 percent of the current black rhino population exists in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Namibia. South Africa, which is home to 40 percent of the rhinos, has already moved some of them to other countries, like Botswana. Chad and South Africa have agreed ""to share experiences and expertise in conservation matters and to assist each other on a reciprocal basis,"" Mr. Matlakeng said in a speech last week, welcoming the rhinos to Chad.

Transporting the animals to create a new population is a plan that can prove effective, Ms. Dean said. ""Some subspecies are performing really well, with an annual growth rate at 9 percent or even higher,"" she said in an email. But moving the rhinos to a place where they once were and no longer are isn't enough. The population must be managed and protected, and law enforcement must play a role, Ms. Dean said. There should also be biological management, guided by effective monitoring. The rhinos cannot be dropped into a location and expected to mate.",The rhinoceroses were flown from South Africa to Chad in an effort to re-establish a population there. They will live — and hopefully breed — at Zakouma National Park.,8946ffdb-d9d0-538c-92ba-b0a90391417e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/13/world/SUB13xp-rhinos/09xp-rhinos-slide-EGF5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=8d0c0ce6f52bc2d3ed10234ba0292af254381f56dd65a9b632097c18ef4c029c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A black rhino ran around in a holding pen after being flown from South Africa.,8946ffdb-d9d0-538c-92ba-b0a90391417e,Demo_data/D1_imgs/18946ffdb-d9d0-538c-92ba-b0a90391417e.jpg,2,20
Food,Restaurants Across the Country Struggle to Respond to Coronavirus,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/dining/restaurants-coronavirus.html,"Empellon in New York. ""With the volatility in the stock market, extreme germophobia and basically no one traveling, we have to hunker down and prepare for an 80 percent decline in business,"" said its chef, Alex Stupak.





Restaurants across America are scrambling to respond to fast-moving developments as the coronavirus spreads. In New York State, bars and restaurants learned Thursday that they would have to cut the number of customers they serve by half starting Friday, to provide more room between tables, under an order from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Tom Douglas, one of Seattle's most prolific restaurateurs, announced Wednesday that he would close 12 of his 13 restaurants for at least two months after the virus had wiped out up to 90 percent of his traffic.

""We are in crisis mode,"" said Rocky Cirino, managing director of Altamarea Group, which has 10 restaurants, five in New York and the others in New Jersey, Washington, Dubai and Istanbul. ""Drastic layoffs may be inevitable. Restaurants are a voluntary gathering place for meetings, for celebrations, for general revelry, for shared sustenance. None of those things will be happening."" Even in cities like Atlanta, where the number of reported coronavirus cases is relatively low, the pandemic has restaurant owners struggling to keep up with canceled reservations and public fears.

""Like everyone, we are getting prepared for the very worst,"" said Steven Satterfield, the chef and an owner of Miller Union, which is formulating a plan to reduce the number of tables to create more space around them in what is becoming known as ""social distancing,"" and to bring takeout food out to customers' cars. Across the country, restaurants are stepping up efforts to streamline operations, designing menu items that can be more easily delivered and doubling down on cleaning, all with an eye on revenues that are shrinking faster than ice cream in July.

""Every few hours, someone walks into the restaurant and says, 'Did you hear this closed?' "" said Mark Canlis, an owner of Canlis, a well-regarded Seattle fine-dining restaurant where business was down by half last week compared with last year at this time, and has continued to fall. No restaurant community has felt the crisis more acutely so far than Seattle's. Washington State has the country's highest number of reported coronavirus cases and deaths, concentrated largely in the Seattle area. ""I feel like we've been one headline away from closing down,"" Mr. Canlis said. To fight back, he said the restaurant would reinvent itself starting Monday. Instead of multicourse dinners, Canlis will serve bagels from an outdoor stand at breakfast and hamburgers for lunch. The hamburgers will be available for drive-through pickup. In the evening, the restaurant will offer home delivery of prepared meals. In New York and other cities, Chinese restaurants are suffering disproportionately, and restaurant operators say they face race-based fear. ""Because we're Malaysian and it's not, like, blatantly Chinese, that kind of saved our butts a little bit,"" said Moonlynn Tsai, an owner of Kopitiam on the Lower East Side, not far from New York's Chinatown. ""It's so sad,"" she said. ""These are the restaurants that have been there for decades.""

Just a day before Governor Cuomo ordered all venues that seat 500 people or fewer to operate at half capacity, Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to continue to eat at restaurants, and emphasized that the virus isn't transmitted through food and drinks. ""It's complicated messaging,"" said Mitchell Davis, the chief strategy officer of the James Beard Foundation, which announced Thursday that it was postponing its annual suite of spring culinary awards events in New York and Chicago until the summer. The organization has also canceled some upcoming events at the James Beard House in Manhattan, and is working on a set of health and safety protocols to distribute to restaurants. ""The biggest challenge we feel is how to be supportive of the industry, which is facing very real challenges, but be responsible when we are saying to people, 'Go eat at restaurants,' "" he said. Without any clear guidelines and guest counts sliding each day, restaurants both big and small are trying to do what they can. Many are sending customers newsletters suggesting delivery or takeout options and emails about sanitation measures. Buffets are being replaced with a la carte items; line cooks are using more utensils and gloved hands to finish dishes; and communal silverware containers are being shelved. Booths and tables are being thoroughly wiped down between guests. At Automatic Seafood and Oysters in Alabama, one of the few states that hasn't had a verified coronavirus case, walk-in traffic has slowed, although reservations have not. But the staff is trying to prepare for what's coming, and do what they can to protect public health. ""We are wiping down the telephones, the computer keyboards, the bathroom door handles -- anything staff would touch in the back we are now very O.C.D. about,"" said Suzanne Humphries, who owns the Birmingham restaurant with her husband, the chef Adam Evans. ""We're thinking of our guests, of course, but thinking of what changes we can do to protect everyone internally."" That might even mean taking the temperature of every staff member before a shift starts. ""It's scary to think about, but we have to think outside the box,"" Mr. Evans said.

At Plumed Horse, a Michelin-starred restaurant in Saratoga, Calif., that is a favorite among the Silicon Valley executives at Apple and Google, half the tables have been removed to allow at least six feet between them. The restaurant now has only 20 tables, said Joshua Weeks, a co-owner. When corporations began banning travel last week, he saw 1,100 cancellations in 72 hours. That number has leveled off, he said. There is also the question of how much and what to tell customers. Some restaurants are sending email blasts, like one from Bocca di Bacco in New York that assured diners that it is sanitizing its three restaurants frequently, and urging both customers and employees who feel ill to stay home. Melany Robinson, owner of the Sprouthouse public relations agency, had fielded so many panicked calls from many of the 55 hospitality clients she represents that she put together a template outlining sanitation and cleanliness standards and sick policies for them to send out. ""People were asking me what to say when the elderly customer calls up and says we want to go out to dinner tonight but we have some questions,"" she said. Fewer customers also means less work, and restaurants are having to cut hours and lay people off. On Thursday in Juneau, Alaska, Beau Schooler, the chef and owner of In Bocca Al Lupo was processing the news that several major cruise companies would suspend operations for the next two months.

The chef Hugh Acheson, who has restaurants in Atlanta and Athens, Ga., said he is worried about meeting payroll for the next two weeks. Even if business picks up, the damage could be long-lasting. ""Who knows when we'll be back to full throttle? And full throttle in this business is low at best,"" he said. ""We don't have the cushion other businesses do."" At Commander's Palace in New Orleans, most of the cancellations have been for private parties with large groups, but Ti Martin, whose family started the restaurant, sees more coming.","Cancellations, closings and a thinning out of tables may be just the beginning for a business based on social contact.",1ab78d89-1ec9-5e78-acbc-988cdd8c2525,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/12/dining/12restaurants1/merlin_169422993_8068dd14-f5c2-49cc-a849-8fe71aa5e3dd-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=949b31686d87718fbce103b27cce61d22bc3102172ba108ba78f1b856f570a8d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Empellón in New York. ""With the volatility in the stock market, extreme germophobia and basically no one traveling, we have to hunker down and prepare for an 80 percent decline in business,"" said its chef, Alex Stupak.",1ab78d89-1ec9-5e78-acbc-988cdd8c2525,Demo_data/D1_imgs/11ab78d89-1ec9-5e78-acbc-988cdd8c2525.jpg,17,17
Technology,Electronic Setups of Driverless Cars Vulnerable to Hackers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/technology/electronic-setups-of-driverless-cars-vulnerable-to-hackers.html,"Any part of a car that talks to the outside world is a potential opportunity for hackers.

That includes the car's entertainment and navigation systems, preloaded music and mapping apps, tire-pressure sensors, even older entry points like a CD drive. It also includes technologies that are still in the works, like computer vision systems and technology that will allow vehicles to communicate with one another.

It will be five to 10 years -- or even more -- before a truly driverless car, without a steering wheel, hits the market. In the meantime, digital automobile security experts will have to solve problems that the cybersecurity industry still has not quite figured out.

Economy,Labor's Hard Choice in Amazon Age: Play Along or Get Tough,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/business/economy/labor-unions-amazon.html,"Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, right, with Stuart Appelbaum, left, a union leader, at a City Hall demonstration last month against a deal to bring an Amazon headquarters to Mr. Van Bramer's Queens district.

It's one of the most vexing challenges facing the labor movement: how to wield influence in an era increasingly dominated by technology giants that are often resistant to unions. Are workers best served when unions take an adversarial stance toward such companies? Or should labor groups seek cooperation with employers, even if the resulting deals do little to advance labor's broader goals? The debate has flared up around labor's efforts to make inroads with the likes of Uber and Airbnb, businesses that allow drivers and homeowners to earn income as contractors. And it was on vivid display in the political battle over Amazon's plan to create a new headquarters in New York with 25,000 jobs. The plan fell apart in the face of a backlash over public subsidies, resentment of the covert process in which the city and the state negotiated the deal, and concern about its neighborhood impact. But labor issues were also a factor, giving rise to tensions even among unions.

""I think we stood on principle,"" said Stuart Appelbaum, the retail workers' president. ""If you're aggressively anti-union, we shouldn't be giving you subsidies."" A company executive told the City Council last month that Amazon would not remain neutral in an organizing campaign at its local facilities, though an Amazon spokesman said this week, ""We respect the rights of our employees to choose to join or not join a union."" In the engagement camp was the local council of building trade unions, whose members were likely to get work from the construction of Amazon's headquarters in Queens. They were joined by a Service Employees International Union local, which had gained the right to represent janitors and other service workers at the Queens complex.

In some respects, these arguments go back decades. Thomas Kochan, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, noted that the United Automobile Workers and General Motors negotiated a new arrangement when the company set up its Saturn division in the mid-1980s. In exchange for a role in managerial duties, the union agreed to forgo many of the work rules typical in other plants, such as those governing which worker could do what job. The arrangement stoked tensions within the union and the company for years. But in recent years the growing reach of tech conglomerates has created urgency within labor to court their workers, Mr. Kochan said. Despite their minimal presence in these companies, unions have a variety of levers to pull. They can exert influence through politicians when public subsidies are involved, as in the Amazon case. And they can pressure regulators to scrutinize businesses that upend traditional industries, like transportation and hospitality. Whether to use these levers to force concessions, or to take a less adversarial approach that would give labor a foothold in big tech, has divided the labor movement. In 2016, Uber reached a five-year agreement with a regional branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers to create a drivers' guild, which would advocate on behalf of drivers but not challenge their status as independent contractors. The Machinists would also have to refrain from turning the guild into a formal union during that time. In exchange, Uber agreed to provide the organization with funding and a way to communicate directly with drivers. The guild says a majority of its revenue comes from other sources.

A rival group representing professional drivers criticized the Machinists for creating a so-called company union -- federal law prohibits unions that companies fund or control, though the law applies only to workers who are employees. Some union officials complained that the guild was anti-democratic, since drivers hadn't elected Machinists officials to represent them. But Sharon Block, a senior Labor Department official under President Barack Obama, argued that the deal was defensible. Ms. Block pointed out that the guild had taken something of a hybrid approach between cooperation and antagonism, lobbying for policies such as a minimum earnings standard for drivers and allowing passengers to tip, both of which have been enacted in New York. ""There are situations in which taking the half loaf can be worthwhile,"" Ms. Block said. Around the same time, the Service Employees International Union was completing a deal with Airbnb in which the company would connect hosts who needed their homes cleaned with unionized workers, an approach that the two sides were already testing in New York and Los Angeles. The agreement collapsed after a prominent hospitality workers union, Unite Here, protested that the deal would merely provide political cover to Airbnb, which the union accuses of destroying good-paying hotel jobs and creating housing shortages. The union's president, D. Taylor, said that Unite Here was always open to working with employers, but that unions typically lacked the clout to cut good deals when they wandered into an industry where their presence was weak. ""You're settling a contract that has lower standards than the dominant union in that industry could get because you don't have leverage,"" Mr. Taylor said. A look inside Amazon. An examination by The New York Times into how the pandemic unfolded inside Amazon's only fulfillment center in New York City, known as JFK8, found that the Covid crisis exposed the power and peril of Amazon's employment system. Here are our major takeaways: Employee churn is high. The company conducted a hiring surge in 2020, signing up 350,000 workers in three months offering a minimum wage of $15 an hour and good benefits. But even before the pandemic, Amazon was losing about 3 percent of its hourly associates each week -- meaning its turnover was roughly 150 percent a year. Buggy systems caused awful mistakes. Amazon's disability and leave system was a source of frustration and panic. Workers who had applied for leaves were penalized for missing work, triggering job-abandonment notices and then terminations. Strict monitoring has created a culture of fear. The company tracks workers' every movement inside its warehouses. Employees who work too slowly, or are idle for too long, risk being fired. The system was designed to identify impediments for workers. Though such firings are rare, some executives worry that the metrics are creating an anxious, negative environment. There is rising concern over racial inequity. The retail giant is largely powered by employees of color. According to internal records from 2019, more than 60 percent of associates at JFK8 are Black or Latino. The records show Black associates at the warehouse were almost 50 percent more likely to be fired than their white peers. Read more: The Amazon That Customers Don't See. Given the number of people Amazon employs -- more than 250,000 in the United States, not including seasonal workers -- and its influence over numerous industries, the proposed New York headquarters arguably represented the highest stakes yet for a test of these competing approaches.

Some experts said a deal allowing a union to represent building-service workers at the proposed Amazon complex could have been valuable. ""They have the opportunity to show the people who work there at all levels that unionization is good,"" said Catherine Fisk, an expert on labor law at the University of California, Berkeley. ""That it's a way to equitably allocate wages, that there is an orderly process for dealing with sexual harassment allegations, with issues about absenteeism -- whatever the company is concerned about."" But others were skeptical that allowing janitorial workers to unionize would have any benefit for the company's broader work force in New York, much less anywhere else in the country. The problem, said Ruth Milkman, a sociologist at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, is that servicing buildings is just too far removed from what most Amazon workers do. Many companies have unionized building-service workers but are otherwise union-free, she said. Like those companies, Amazon seemed intent on drawing the line at service workers: It walked away from discussions with labor about a framework that could have made it easier to organize employees who perform core functions, like packing goods at the company's fulfillment centers.

But there is reason to believe that Amazon may have to bargain with labor in New York at some point, and that unions and other progressive groups will have established an important principle when that happens. After all, many of Amazon's facilities are not like automobile plants or call centers, in that the company can easily plunk them down anywhere. Amazon tends to locate warehouses reasonably close to customers, of whom there are potentially millions in the New York area. It has sought to put its white-collar hubs in areas with many high-skilled workers, a practice that also favors cities like New York. In its statement about the demise of the Queens plan, the company noted that there ""are currently over 5,000 Amazon employees in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island, and we plan to continue growing these teams."" And that logic is likely to apply to a variety of tech companies that seek customers and workers in liberal hubs. ""You don't have huge numbers of highly educated people who they need who want to move to small cities in Arkansas,"" Professor Fisk said. ""I think California and New York and a lot of other places may have more leverage to insist on the highroad approach.""","The battle over Amazon's New York plans resurfaced tensions among unions over how to deal with Uber, Airbnb and other emerging giants.",1aec52dd-383d-51a6-94cb-a81a197e07f1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/22/business/22amazonlabor1/22amazonlabor1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2bc7b3798c9a8bb9a92dcbf69af482b4005e4a68df7bb672674f003bfbd450e3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, right, with Stuart Appelbaum, left, a union leader, at a City Hall demonstration last month against a deal to bring an Amazon headquarters to Mr. Van Bramer&rsquo;s Queens district.",1aec52dd-383d-51a6-94cb-a81a197e07f1,Demo_data/D1_imgs/11aec52dd-383d-51a6-94cb-a81a197e07f1.jpg,8,20
Well,Hands of the Dying Offer a Unique Memorial,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/well/live/hands-of-the-dying-offer-a-unique-memorial.html,"For the families of people near death, Trish Rogers provides a unique memorial. At the bedside, she creates a cast of the dying patient's hand, sometimes by itself, but more often joined with the hand of a loved one. The casts are exact reproductions that capture wrinkles, scars, veins, fingernails and the other odd, quirky features that make hands as distinctive as faces. She makes them free of charge for any family who requests them. Ms. Rogers, an administrative assistant in critical care at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, began making the casts more than a decade ago, after a colleague mentioned hearing about the process at a conference.

Jennifer Foster, whose husband, Christopher, was struck and fatally injured by a truck last year, said that when she heard about the casts, ""I knew right away that it was something I wanted."" Mr. Foster, 32, had been declared brain-dead. He was an organ donor, and Ms. Rogers made the cast in the intensive care unit, shortly before he was taken to the operating room. His wedding ring had been removed in the emergency room the day he was hit, and Ms. Foster was wearing it on a chain around her neck. She and Ms. Rogers put the ring back on his finger, and then Ms. Foster held her husband's hand. ""I was very emotional,"" Ms. Foster said. ""I was crying, trying to get down kind of close to where he was so I was near him.""

As family members watched -- Ms. Foster's parents and sisters, her husband's mother and other relatives -- Ms. Rogers guided the couple's hands, immersing them in a bucket of gel to create a mold. When the gel set, she helped ease their hands out. Then she poured plaster into the mold to create the cast. A week later she presented the cast, mounted on a wood plaque, to Ms. Foster. ""It looks exactly like his hand,"" Ms. Foster said. ""Everything is the same. I highly cherish it."" She keeps the cast on a shelf in her bedroom where she sees it every day, alongside a photograph of her husband and the urn containing his ashes. ""When the accident happened and I went into the hospital room where he was, I grabbed his hand and told him I'd never let it go,"" Ms. Foster said. ""And now I'll truly never let it go."" Ms. Rogers still has vivid memories of making her first cast, from the hand of a young woman who had been ill for a long time. ""I remember thinking, 'Man, I need a bucket underneath my eyes,' because I just bawled,"" Ms. Rogers said. ""For a while, I would cry at every one. Then, instead of crying I would just profusely sweat. Now I don't, because I know what this means for families."" She has never made a cast of a member of her own family. ""I think that's part of what drives me to do it,"" she said. ""I wish I had one of my mother."" Her mother died in 1996, long before she began making the casts.

Requests for her craft have grown over the years as word has spread. Since last summer, she said, she has made about 60 casts. She usually gives the finished product to families outside the hospital, because for many it is too painful to come back inside so soon.

For parents of infants who have died, Ms. Rogers has created casts of the adults' hands together cradling the child's feet. When a parent dies, she makes a cast for each child. If the children are young, families often wait until they are old enough to understand before showing them the casts. Dr. Buddy Hurst received one of Ms. Rogers's casts when his wife, Carolyn, died in 2015, after 46 years of marriage. His wife was particular about her fingernails and did her own manicures, and the impeccable results show up clearly on the cast, Dr. Hurst said. Ms. Rogers also made separate casts for his three adult daughters, each holding her mother's hand. ""It was very meaningful to us,"" Dr. Hurst said. ""Hands are really so distinctive and expressive and recognizable. It's a powerful ministry she's doing, providing these tangible memorials for people who are facing the loss of a loved one. If other places knew about it and had the capability of doing it, it would be a very valuable service for families to give them a little bit of comfort going forward.""","For families of people near death, Trish Rogers provides a unique memorial — a cast made from the patient's hand, often joined with the hand of a loved one.",d1520f77-65ca-57b6-87dd-0ed3a6c24e91,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/07/well/HANDS7/HANDS7-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=656d14ea022cc049bfc0b1288458b91fce345d14bdb8ea007c331b541f05a075&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A cast of a dying person's hand, often clasping the hand of a loved one, can provide a tangible remembrance to a grieving family.",d1520f77-65ca-57b6-87dd-0ed3a6c24e91,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1d1520f77-65ca-57b6-87dd-0ed3a6c24e91.jpg,18,14
Economy,Economic Strain Persists Even as Businesses Reopen,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html,"Employers continue to lay workers off while states struggle through a backlog of unemployment claims, a sign of the persistent strain the economy faces from the coronavirus pandemic even as businesses begin to reopen. The Labor Department reported Thursday that nearly 1.9 million Americans filed new claims for state unemployment benefits last week, continuing the decline from the more than six million who submitted applications in a single week in March but still a remarkably high level. In addition, there were 623,000 new claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the federal program intended to help the self-employed and others not normally eligible for state jobless benefits. The overall number collecting state benefits increased by almost 650,000 to a seasonally adjusted total of 21.5 million, showing that even as some businesses reopen and workers come off the rolls, others are being newly laid off or belatedly starting to receive benefits.

Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the weekly claims ""are not falling as fast as I'd like them to fall or thought they would be falling."" ""Let's not kid ourselves,"" he added. ""This is still an astonishing rate of layoffs."" Since mid-March, 42.6 million jobless workers have applied for state aid, marking the worst period for unemployment since the Great Depression. The seasonally adjusted data does not include those who have applied under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. The government count also leaves out people who were stymied in their attempts to receive the benefits or were too disheartened or confused to try. Mistakes, delays in reporting and possible double-counting in some areas also complicate efforts to arrive at a precise total. Some people out of work have gone months without government assistance as states grapple with technical glitches and a flood of claims. Payments have abruptly evaporated for some workers, who have struggled to reach overwhelmed unemployment administrators for an explanation. Bogus sites that mimic government unemployment portals, and fraudulent claims submitted using stolen personal data, have prompted many states to impose security measures that complicate the approval process.

Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton, said the recent looting and vandalism in many cities further clouded the employment outlook. ""The unrest adds insult to injury in an economy already struggling to reopen,"" she said. ""It could delay workers being called back or cause people to be laid off again."" For many jobless workers, stability remains a distant prospect. On Friday, the Labor Department will report the unemployment rate in May, which many economists say could approach or exceed 20 percent, up from 14.7 percent in April. The layoffs have grown from the restaurant workers and hotel employees who lost their jobs early in the pandemic to people in management positions, economists said. And state unemployment offices are wading through a backlog of claims, processing older applications that may only now be appearing in official counts. The economic rebound will probably unfurl in two phases, said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. The first will happen quickly, as companies call back certain employees to help reopen restaurants, retailers and other operations. The second step will drag on for months, as lingering fears of infection and the disruption in earnings weigh on spending and affect the ability of businesses, especially small ones, to return to normal. Mr. Daco said it was encouraging that initial applications for state benefits and for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program declined last week, but added that the volume was still stunning and likely to remain elevated. ""We're witnessing a gradual evolution from temporary to persistent labor market damage,"" he said. The pandemic has gone on so long that some workers are reaching the end of their allotment of benefits -- and some could face more delays as states try to carry out a federal program that offers an extra 13 weeks of aid.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""There might be a series of income cliffs coming up as benefits fade out, and tranches of the population that may have helped spur a rebound in spending may drop off,"" Mr. Daco said.

Unemployed workers in most of the country are eligible for 26 weeks of regular state benefits, which would give someone laid off in mid-March a cushion until September. States like Michigan and Kansas, which usually offer fewer weeks of payments, recently raised their maximum allowances to 26 weeks. But Florida and North Carolina cap their unemployment payouts at 12 weeks. The federal extension program, known as Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, could give workers a lifeline into December. Some states may offer additional extended benefits. But Diana Terlingo, 55, has yet to receive any payment. Ms. Terlingo, who was furloughed in mid-April from her job approving travel expenses for a retail chain, said work petered out after employees stopped going on business trips. She began working again two weeks ago, operating out of her home in Pembroke Pines, Fla. In the six weeks she was unemployed, she received none of the $5,000 she believes she is owed in state and federal aid.

Her husband, who runs a family business selling modular office furniture that has had no customers for weeks, secured a $16,000 loan through the federal Paycheck Protection Program but did not seek benefits through the state. Their son Sean O'Reilly, 31, was furloughed in mid-March from a hotel restaurant and would be on the verge of exhausting his unemployment payments from Florida if the money had ever arrived. For now, the family has avoided disaster, having saved diligently for years and arranged flexibility with creditors.

""We're in a better position than some people,"" Ms. Terlingo said. ""We're not the starving ones."" As businesses reopen, jobless workers are starting to seek in-person help. At job fairs around the country, hospitals are seeking nurses and school districts are looking for bus drivers. CareerSource Florida, a state agency helping job seekers, recently began offering on-site assistance by appointment. Last month, the Alabama Department of Labor set up stations around Montgomery to help people with their claims, but limited the number of visitors and suggested that they bring lawn chairs and snacks to pass the time in line. The increased activity has led to optimism that the job market has started ""crawling out of the hole,"" said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. ""We do have the worst behind us."" Eric Latham, a 26-year-old restaurant worker living in Fayette, spent days calling the Alabama agency after nearly $1,600 in benefits failed to show up in his account. While updating his unemployment claim one week, he noted that he had briefly worked for his employer for one day during his furlough, a detail that seemed to cut off his payments. ""That was two weeks of very little income -- that set me back,"" he said. ""I need it. I have bills. But I'll probably just have to eat it."" Mr. Latham returned to work on Thursday, despite reservations about the coronavirus. Reopening efforts are proceeding slowly, as government officials and business owners try to stave off more infections. Donald Franklin III, 21, was furloughed in March from his manufacturing job in Aliquippa, Pa., 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh near the Ohio border. He received one unemployment check and has tried in vain to reach the Pennsylvania unemployment office to inquire after the rest of his benefits. Now home in Ohio, he is worried about having enough money to pay his bills. He received some family money, scaled back his spending and asked for an extension on his internet bill.

Eager to get back to work, he is hoping for a call from his employer, which has begun restoring shifts. But because Mr. Franklin works nights, he is concerned that rioting could lead to curfews that keep him from traveling to his job. He is also nervous that if the stores that carry his company's products are looted, demand might tumble. Mr. Franklin, who is of mixed race, sympathizes with protesters demonstrating against police violence. ""There definitely needs to be a change in the world right now,"" he said. ""I can definitely see where everyone is coming from. I totally understand all the perspectives. I'm just worried about my livelihood.""",State jobless rolls increased last week as some workers were newly laid off and others belatedly started to receive benefits.,3064e29d-49f1-5b16-aed1-cfc635e198f4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/05/business/04JPvirus-jobless1-print/04virus-jobless1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=0e72b897487ff264fdd4da7b1e1d755edb542ee08746892de90e729fe16997d2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Eric Latham in Alabama returned to his restaurant to work last Thursday, despite reservations about the coronavirus.",3064e29d-49f1-5b16-aed1-cfc635e198f4,Demo_data/D1_imgs/13064e29d-49f1-5b16-aed1-cfc635e198f4.jpg,8,8
Style,Comedian Julio Torres Changes His Hair Color (Again),https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/style/julio-torres-hbo-special-los-espookys.html,"Six years ago, Julio Torres, the comedian, former ""Saturday Night Live"" writer and bilingual surrealist, decided to dye his hair. He called Marcy Ozuna, a hairdresser who works out of a narrow shop on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village. ""It's time,"" he told her. ""You were so excited,"" Mr. Torres said. ""We did it drastic, so drastic,"" Ms. Ozuna said. ""I was like, that's not my boy."" On a sticky Wednesday earlier this month, her ""boy,"" whom she also calls ""Julito"" and ""baby,"" was back. Mr. Torres had just returned from a trip to Greece with his friends Ana Fabrega and Greta Titelman , who star alongside him in the eerie Spanish-language comedy ""Los Espookys."" The Aegean sun had left his hair a pallid beige.

Geometric forms are crucially important to Mr. Torres. In the hourlong HBO special, which premiered on Aug. 10, he sits onstage behind a conveyor belt that brings him various objects -- a crystal, a cactus, a piece of chocolate. He proceeds to describe each in mundane and hilarious detail . After some small talk, Ms. Ozuna wrapped him a shiny black cape and got to work. They have known each other for 10 years, ever since Mr. Torres, who had moved from El Salvador to attend the New School, admired the haircut on a roommate's friend and found himself at Salon G, in Ms. Ozuna's station, and he loved her right away. That station wasn't always decorated with framed magazine cutouts of Mr. Torres. It is now. ""I told my co-worker, I want my boy next to me,"" Ms. Ozuna said, dancing around him in red platform sandals. She has never seen his stand-up, arcane routines that emphasize his not-from-around-here perspective. Nor had she seen his bizarrely funny ""S.N.L."" shorts, like ""Papyrus"" (starring Ryan Gosling as a man obsessed with the font used in the ""Avatar"" movie poster) and ""Wells for Boys"" (a spoof commercial for a toy wishing well for ""sensitive boys"").

She spent years persuading him to abandon his brown hair and now, every three or four months, they experiment with different shades of blond: ash, metallic, vanilla, champagne. Once, briefly, they went black. On ""Los Espookys,"" his character, Andres , has blue hair; as soon as Mr. Torres returned home from the set in Santiago, Chile, he went to Ms. Ozuna to correct it. ""Like Immediately. Like the next day,"" he said."" By the time he left for Greece, she had made him a strawberry blonde. ""Red always fades,"" Ms. Ozuna said, philosophically as she moved to the back of the salon to create his color. She started dyeing hair in the '80s, making colors out of Kool-Aid. Now, she mixes hues by hand, infusing a peroxide base with three or four shades, softening it with vitamin E oil and jojoba oil. She returned with the color, presenting the chestnut liquid like an offering. ""This is what Julito tells me all the time, 'Marcy you're an artist,'"" she said.

She applied the dye with a broad brush, then worked it in with her gloved hands (""I like to feel it all the way through,"" she said) until his hair stood out in spikes, like the crown on the Statue of Liberty. The priest in the next chair leaned over to admire her work. ""This color is going to be delicious,"" Ms. Ozuna added. She let it sit for a few minutes, then took Mr. Torres to the back for a shampoo and rinse, before squeezing his hair dry with a towel. But when she pulled the towel away, something had gone wrong. His hair didn't look like sunset. It didn't look delicious. It look more like eggplant purple. ""Should we make it lighter?"" he said. She agreed. ""When we do color, we play together,"" she said. ""We're playing, changing, working. We have to get what he wants."" She mixed the color more quickly this time and poured it into a plastic squeeze bottle, drizzling it onto his hair like a butterscotch sauce on top of a sundae and working it through again. He looked like a firework, as he bent his neck back into the sink. ""I killed the violet,"" she said, as she rinsed his hair. ""The violet was in my way."" She wrapped him in a new cape, brown with a leopard print. His hoop earring had fallen out during the shampoo, but she found it in the sink's drain. In a hand mirror, he admired his damp hair.

""Julito, grab my blower,"" she said. Back in the front of the salon, Ms. Ozuna applied a clear finishing treatment, blew his hair dry and trimmed it with pink scissors, before taking a razor to the ends and working some pomade through until it gleamed like a fire opal. ""Oh it's fantastic,"" he said. ""It's what I wanted."" She told him not to shampoo his hair or expose it to chlorine. He told her he planned to spend the coming weekend in the pool at Fire Island. Her face fell. ""I'll come back,"" he said.","The former ""S.N.L."" writer stars in ""Los Espookys"" and an HBO standup comedy special.",06bfefd1-17e6-581e-9871-7042736c297a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/18/fashion/00ENCOUNTERS-Torresg/merlin_158408619_8ad778bf-948a-49ca-95dc-499ef9c5a5c1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a216df716cc368535e3eae971647ff0f53c7ef20ff895dc5bc4410e690013611&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Julio Torres, a comedian and writer, got his hair dyed at Salon G in Greenwich Village.",06bfefd1-17e6-581e-9871-7042736c297a,Demo_data/D1_imgs/106bfefd1-17e6-581e-9871-7042736c297a.jpg,15,10

Automobiles,A New Species of Battery-Driven BMW,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/automobiles/autoreviews/a-new-species-of-battery-driven-bmw-.html,"The BMW i3 is a deep dive into what the car of the future should be. It is efficient, sustainable and essentially a think tank on wheels.

One look at the electric i3 makes it clear that BMW is heading into the organic, macrobiotic wilderness. From the front, with its kidney-shape nostrils and black wraparound mask, the car resembles nothing so much as Procyon lotor, the North American raccoon. This hatchback's quirky, design-forward shape, stubby proportions and save-the-world powertrain put it a world apart from any previous BMW, even the i8 plug-in hybrid sports car with which it shares much of its structural DNA. The i3 is available from 285 of the 339 BMW dealers throughout the United States. The lightweight carbon-fiber passenger cell is bolted and bonded to a flat aluminum structure that supports the drivetrain, protects the 22 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, holds the front and rear suspension and provides front- and rear-impact absorption. The rear-mounted, 170-horsepower electric motor and single-ratio transmission drive the rear wheels. An optional range extender -- a small 2-cylinder engine borrowed from BMW's 650 cc scooters -- can roughly double the car's range, to an estimated 150 miles. Without the extender, the estimated range is 81 miles. Eco Pro Plus mode, which reduces power and limits the climate control, adds about 20 miles. A full charge takes about 3.5 hours on 220 volts; figure up to 20 hours on 110 volts.

Inside, the i3 feels as different as it looks. The dashboard is a wave of eucalyptus apparently inspired by Charles and Ray Eames. And like much modern furniture, the interior looks better than it feels. The manually adjusted seats are thinly padded, the interior fabric is prickly, the olive-leaf-tanned leather is stiff and the rough-stitched seams of the center armrest and door chafe the driver's forearms. One's first drive will be a staccato experience. Lifting off the accelerator results in pronounced, immediate regenerative braking; to avoid turning passengers into bobbleheads I learned to maintain a little accelerator pressure even when slowing to a stop. The strong regen braking makes most driving a one-pedal affair, but this poses a problem: The brake lights illuminate with a full lift of the accelerator; if you reduce speed slowly, they may stay dark. Drivers behind, expecting brake lights on a slowing car, may not be amused. Steering is quick and precise, though road feel is lacking, and the i3 is eager to occupy any gap in rush-hour traffic. With its short wheelbase, tight turning circle and minimal overhangs, the car is highly maneuverable: It feels as if you're driving from the upper floor of a double-decker Mini Cooper.

The i3 may not look fast, but its acceleration is immediate and addictive. The electric motor's 170-horsepower rating is deceiving; the i3's light weight and relentless torque (peaking at 184 pound-feet) make it feel as quick in a straight line as it is veering into Trader Joe's. Zero-to-60 acceleration comes in 6.5 seconds, according to testing by Car and Driver magazine, and the i3 pulls with surprising strength toward its top speed of 93 m.p.h.

Using all this power is a guilty pleasure, as it reduces range with each lunge from a stoplight and each additional digit on the speedometer. I recorded a low range of about 70 miles in uninhibited freeway blasting and a high of nearly 120 miles using Eco Pro Plus mode in stop-and-go urban crawling. The satellite navigation system monitors the expected range; if you run out of juice in an i3 with navigation, you can't say you haven't been warned. BMW calls the suspension of the i3 stiff. They're not kidding, especially if the car has the optional 20-inch tires. The combination of a high seating position, rigid structure, stiff suspension rates and thin 20-inch tires gave it a disconcerting side-to-side rocking motion over uneven pavement. My head felt like a metronome. I ride dirt bikes in the Mojave Desert, sail a 14-foot sailboat in the open Pacific and enjoy in-flight turbulence. Even so, I found the rocking motion uncomfortable, to the point of giving me a vague headache on anything but perfectly smooth roads. I took a short drive in another i3 with the standard 19-inch tires. The ride was much improved, the rocking motion far less objectionable. Though even with the standard tires, the i3 is on the stiff side for routine in-town errands. Also, a short-hop E.V. should be optimized for picking up human offspring and dropping them off with minimum fuss. But the i3's rear-hinged rear doors leave the back-seat passengers trapped unless the corresponding front door is opened. The base Mega World i3 retails for $42,300. The well-optioned Giga World test car was $48,675, less a $7,500 federal E.V. tax credit and any state incentives. There's more than one way to skin a raccoon, and BMW has made the i3 a showpiece of haute design and aerospace technology at the expense of some day-in, day-out convenience and creature comforts. The similarly priced Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive accomplishes roughly equal performance with a heavier, more conventional steel structure and makes up the difference with a larger battery pack obtained from Tesla. If you want to attract I'm-saving-the-polar-bears attention -- and the occasional confused, amorous Procyon lotor -- the i3 could be your brave new transport pod. But if you just want to drive yourself and your family in convenience and comfort, with minimal use of planet-choking petroleum, there may be better choices.","The BMW i3's quirky, design-forward shape, stubby proportions and save-the-world powertrain put it a world apart from any previous BMW.",4f9aece5-348a-53bf-8913-1105db6b88fc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/19/automobiles/ELECTRIC/ELECTRIC-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=296&w=600&s=c773ece8eee1e038cd7a8f2f8872007fe7f34583d77934eebce12e81dc588737&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Its quirky design, stubby proportions and electric powertrain set the i3 apart.",4f9aece5-348a-53bf-8913-1105db6b88fc,Demo_data/D1_imgs/14f9aece5-348a-53bf-8913-1105db6b88fc.jpg,23,23
Science,"Watch Saturn Shine on Friday, No Equipment Required",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/03/science/saturn-opposition-rings-titan.html,"Astronomically speaking, Mars and Mercury dominated May. But now that it's June, Saturn has a chance to shine.

Our solar system's ""Lord of the Rings"" will be at opposition starting the early morning hours of Friday, meaning it will align with Earth and the sun.

It will be visible all night, rising at the exact point in the sky opposite where the sun sets. Saturn reaches opposition around 3 a.m. Eastern time, but the best time to look for it will be after midnight your local time when it is highest in the night sky. You'll be able to see the ringed planet glow throughout the summer.

An easy way to spot Saturn is to let Mars be your guide. The red planet, which reached its own opposition earlier this week, will be a hard-to-miss bright crimson dot.

Opinion,Did the Coronavirus Kill Ideology in Australia?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/opinion/coronavirus-australia.html,"HOBART, Australia -- Until four months ago few leaders seemed more influenced -- even inspired -- by President Trump's worldview than Australia's prime minister, Scott Morrison. Mr. Morrison's government was climate-denying, globalism-bashing and displayed an increasingly authoritarian bent. His rhetoric, even if it lacked the sriracha of Trumpetry, riffed on Trumpian themes. And given a good crisis, Mr. Morrison's administration seemed as determined as the White House to miss no opportunity to make matters worse -- as it did with its grossly inept response to Australia's summer of apocalyptic wild fires. Having seen this almost impossibly low bar set for government action, many Australians have felt relief tinged with astonishment knowing that their country is today among the world's most successful in dealing with the coronavirus epidemic. By some measures, it nearly rivals South Korea and has done better than Singapore and Germany.

As of Monday morning, Australia, with its 25.5 million people, had recorded a total of 7,054 infections and 99 deaths, according to Worldometers. That's 277 infections and four deaths for every million people. In the United States, the per capita figures were 4,619 infections and 275 deaths per million by Monday; in Britain, 3,592 infections and 511 deaths per million. According to Mr. Morrison's treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, the former prime minister John Howard, the eminence grise of Australian conservatism and its many culture wars, counseled Mr. Morrison and Mr. Frydenberg that ""there's no ideological constraints at times like this."" Mr. Frydenberg added, ""That's the advice we have taken."" Mr. Morrison went so far as to declare: ""Today is not about ideologies. We checked those at the door."" Mr. Howard spoke from experience. A fiercely right-wing prime minister, when confronted in 1996 with the horror of 35 people being shot dead at Port Arthur, in Tasmania, he moved decisively to enact strong gun-control laws. No mass shootings occurred in the next 20 years, according to a 2016 report, and the decline in firearm deaths accelerated. There have been only two mass shootings since, one of seven people and one of four. Following Mr. Morrison's own Damascene moment, things once deemed fantastical became commonplace. Scientists, whom Mr. Morrison's party has derided for over a decade, were respectfully asked for their views about the novel coronavirus and, more remarkable still, these views were acted on and amplified. Mr. Morrison dismissed the idea of trying to build herd immunity among the population, calling it a ""death sentence."" A national cabinet was formed in which the states' premiers (the equivalent of governors) from both the left and the right regularly met by video to plot the course of the nation through the crisis. In this way and others, a government that has been sectarian and divisive became inclusive.

And yet Australia's success has received little global attention. New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, struts the world stage, leading in scores of stories about countries that are succeeding against the coronavirus, exuding charisma, but charisma excludes Mr. Morrison, who seems condemned to watch from the wings. Could it be that Australia's record somehow embarrasses commentators of both the left and the right? The left, because the Australian government is in every other respect Trumpian in its male-led, climate-denying, nationalist tub-thumping and authoritarian sentiments; the right because a conservative government has succeeded only by very publicly abandoning ideology. And if ideology, and the culture wars, are nothing when everything is at stake, the inevitable question arises: Did they ever mean anything at all? Now, with the beginning of a return to normalcy, the strange miracle of this Australian consensus already is starting to vanish, with old habits renascent. The government body overseeing the country's recovery, the National Covid-19 Coordination Committee, has been criticized as secretive and unaccountable, and for promoting policies to revive the economy that favor the fossil-fuel industry. Sinister new powers for the national spy agency are being rushed through Parliament, and opposition is growing to the government's plans to end, in the name of financial rectitude, its generous wage and unemployment packages in September. Even so, these remarkable few months will remain a rebuke to the murderous madness of ruling through division, a testament of hope to all that can be achieved when ideology is ditched. Presented with growing doubts about democracy's ability to deal with the pandemic on the one hand, and the seeming ability of a totalitarian China to address the crisis on the other, Australia unexpectedly, if only briefly, returned to its best traditions of communality and fairness. While the world searches for a vaccine for the virus, the vaccine for its coming crises -- not least among them climate change -- is perhaps hiding in plain sight: unite, listen and act with all, for all, rather than special interests. Perhaps this is the future, the only future, and not just for Australia, but for any democracy seeking to hold through this new, terrifying age.

Opinion,The National Humiliation We Need,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/opinion/coronavirus-july-4.html,"We Americans enter the July 4 weekend of 2020 humiliated as almost never before. We had one collective project this year and that was to crush Covid-19, and we failed. On Wednesday, we had about 50,000 new positive tests, a record. Other nations are beating the disease while our infection lines shoot upward as sharply as they did in March. This failure will lead to other failures. A third of Americans show signs of clinical anxiety or depression, according to the Census Bureau. Suspected drug overdose deaths surged by 42 percent in May. Small businesses, colleges and community hubs will close. At least Americans are not in denial about the nation's turmoil of the last three months. According to a Pew survey, 71 percent of Americans are angry about the state of the country right now and 66 percent are fearful. Only 17 percent are proud.

Americans are reacting in two positive ways. We're seeing incredible shifts in attitudes toward race. Roughly 60 percent of Americans now believe that African-Americans face a great deal or a lot of discrimination. People have been waiting for a white backlash since the riots, or since the statues started toppling. There isn't much if any evidence of a backlash. There's evidence of a fore-lash. Second, Americans have decided to get rid of Donald Trump. His mishandling of Covid-19 hurt him among seniors. His racist catcalls in a time of racial reckoning have damaged him among all groups. I'll be delighted when Trump goes, but it's worth pointing out that it wasn't only because of Donald Trump that Americans never really locked down, and then started moving around again in late April. It wasn't Trump who went out to bars in Tempe, Austin and Los Angeles in June. It wasn't Trump who put on hospital gowns and told the American people you could suspend the lockdown if your cause was just. Once you told people they could suspend the lockdown for one thing, they were going to suspend it for others. Our fixation on the awfulness of Donald Trump has distracted us from the larger problems and rendered us strangely passive in the face of them. Sure, this was a Republican failure, but it was also a collective failure, and it follows a few decades of collective failures.

On the day Trump leaves office, we'll still have a younger generation with worse life prospects than their parents had faced. We'll still have a cultural elite that knows little about people in red America and daily sends the message that they are illegitimate. We'll still have yawning inequalities, residential segregation, crumbling social capital, a crisis in family formation. Trump's rise in 2016 was a symptom of all these crises, long before he had a chance to become an additional cause of them. What's the core problem? Damon Linker is on to a piece of it: ""It amounts to a refusal on the part of lots of Americans to think in terms of the social whole -- of what's best for the community, of the common or public good. Each of us thinks we know what's best for ourselves."" I'd add that this individualism, atomism and selfishness is downstream from a deeper crisis of legitimacy. In 1970, in a moment like our own, Irving Kristol wrote, ""In the same way as men cannot for long tolerate a sense of spiritual meaninglessness in their individual lives, so they cannot for long accept a society in which power, privilege, and property are not distributed according to some morally meaningful criteria."" A lot of people look around at the conditions of this country -- how Black Americans are treated, how communities are collapsing, how Washington doesn't work -- and none of it makes sense. None of it inspires faith, confidence. In none of it do they feel a part. If you don't breathe the spirit of the nation, if you don't have a fierce sense of belonging to each other, you're not going to sacrifice for the common good. We're confronted with a succession of wicked problems and it turns out we're not even capable of putting on a friggin' mask. In the days leading up to this July 4 weekend, I've been thinking about a scene in ""Good Will Hunting.""

Fashion & Style,A Shades of Gray Show That Was Genuinely Worth Watching,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/fashion/thom-browne-valentino-paris-fashion-week.html,"Forget lapel pins or white roses or black; the Oscars drew a line in that sand, anyway. Sunday night in Paris, Thom Browne made an utterly convincing statement about female strength and sexuality. He may have been an ocean away from Los Angeles, but it was as theatrical as any film, and as potent. It began in a vast ballroom of the Hotel de Ville, Paris's city hall, with a central island filled with canvases propped up on easels. Out came a procession of painters -- imaginary doppelgangers of Elisabeth Louise Vigee Le Brun, Marie Antoinette's favorite portrait painter and a woman who made her way in a man's world -- in beige jackets and gray bloomers, the legs exaggerated to hoop-skirt size, their hair jutting back in towering cones.

It was less a fetishization of the female body (an approach that would be questionable at this point in time) than a demand for recognition of the feminist form with a touch of levity. There's been some rumbling this red carpet season about women taking political positions in evening gowns while still exploiting their ""assets"" -- as The Daily Mail says -- in the classic cleavage-and-curves way. Mr. Browne backhanded that out of the room.

As Pierpaolo Piccioli said, leaning in with some unexpected urgency before a verdant Valentino show, held on the same day Italy went to the polls: ""Very often, if you make clothes you feel are doing something that is not really meaningful for society, but I feel you can use clothes to deliver a message. Italy right now is choosing whether to embrace discrimination and I hate all forms of discrimination."" That's why he opened his show with the Sudanese model Adut Akech, and closed it with the Afro-French Assa Baradji, and used his work to prove that romanticism -- not about relationships, but about life -- could be a strength rather than a weakness. The cliches of the genre (flowers, pink), were turned into power symbols: Pansies in black and white and caramel appeared as intarsia on wool tunics and capes and knee-high leather boots with stacked heels, so instead of being merely decorative they were built into the structure of the garment.

It's hard to add this kind of dimension to fashion. You can easily fall over the edge into pretentiousness or fakery. And not everyone is comfortable with the idea: At Akris, Albert Kriemler's liquid C-suite leathers, knits and silks in jade and lapis lazuli remained quiet in their confidence; at Sacai, Chitose Abe stuck to her usual cut-and-paste of forms and fabrics (school blazers, down jackets, tennis sweaters, chiffon), with her usual, if occasionally overcomplicated, aplomb. When she first introduced this ""hybridization"" approach, she was ahead of the curve. Now the curve is moving on a bit; so, hopefully, will she.

But when it works -- as it did at Valentino wonderfully well, and as it did at Stella McCartney, where the suit linings became the stuff of slip dresses false-fronted onto velvet and knits, and portraits of women by the British artist J.H. Lynch were revealed under sheer lace and tulle shirts, the normally unseen elevated and exposed to the light -- it raises the bar for everyone.

Even more so when the reintroduction of a house is at stake. The new life of Poiret, now owned by the South Korean fashion and beauty conglomerate Shinsegae International, should by all rights have been a major event: Paul Poiret was one of the most influential designers of the early 20th century; there was a retrospective devoted to his work at the Met in 2007; the house has been dormant for almost 90 years -- and he was the designer who freed women from the corset, for goodness' sake! He embraced multiculturalism before the word existed. The timing was perfect.

And yet somehow, despite many pieces that spoke to the history of the brand, especially puffer egg-shaped opera coats burnished in gold, and jumpsuits and day dresses made from two rectangles of fabric crisscrossed in front (plus some pieces that looked a lot like Lanvin used to under Alber Elbaz), there was nothing to love. The animating spirit of the house had not been adapted to the contemporary era, even if the designs were. Once upon a time it set off a revolution. Now it's missing one.","Drawing the feminist form at Thom Browne, true romance at Valentino and facing the future at Stella McCartney.",6ff9cdfc-6e2e-5587-a286-77a4fda7627c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/06/fashion/06BROWNEREVIEW-INYT-thombrowne/06BROWNREVIEW-INYT-thombrowne-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a77a28335e24d00ea94b71d1c09a499de10fc6de92d5cc6b7c6dd0f2123de42f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Thom Browne, fall 2018.",6ff9cdfc-6e2e-5587-a286-77a4fda7627c,Demo_data/D1_imgs/16ff9cdfc-6e2e-5587-a286-77a4fda7627c.jpg,19,19
Fashion & Style,Fashion's Newest Frontier: The Disabled and the Displaced,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/fashion/solution-based-design-disabled-refugees.html,"Six years ago, Maura Horton, a housewife in Raleigh, N.C., received a call from her husband, Don, the assistant football coach at North Carolina State. He was on the road for a game and having so much trouble buttoning his shirt, he had to ask a player (Russell Wilson, now the quarterback of the Seattle Seahawks) for help. Mr. Horton had received a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease four years before, and symptoms were starting to worsen. So Mrs. Horton did what anyone would do these days when faced with such a problem: She searched Google for ""easy-to-close shirt."" And found ... not much.

""And then I looked at my iPad cover and saw it had these really small magnets, and thought, 'Well, what about that?'"" she says now -- a patent, a company and 22 shirt styles later. MagnaReady makes shirts with magnetic closures instead of buttons. Mrs. Horton (who once designed children's wear but stopped to start her family) and her company, MagnaReady, are part of a new sub-sector in fashion: what Chaitenya Razdan, the founder and chief executive of Care and Wear, has christened ""healthwear."" The sector takes the tools and techniques (and trends) of fashion and applies them to the challenges created by illness and disability. And healthwear is simply one part of a larger movement, in which classically trained designers (and those they work with) are rethinking the basic premise, and promise, of fashion itself. Call it solution-based design. Though fashion is often dismissed as frivolous and self-indulgent, this growing niche suggests that rather than being part of the problem -- and a symbol of the multiple divisions in society (political, personal, economic) -- it can actually come up with some of the answers. In May, for example, Angela Luna was named a designer of the year at Parsons School of Design at the New School for a graduate collection of convertible garments that used outerwear to address specific issues of the refugee crisis: shelter, flotation, visibility. So there was a hip utility coat that could become a tent, and a padded jacket that became a sleeping bag. One anorak had a built-in flotation device; another, a baby carrier.

""It started when a professor of mine challenged us to do something that would change the world,"" Ms. Jones said. ""I thought: 'How can I do that? This is fashion.'"" A view of the jacket assembled into a tent. But then she began talking to a 14-year-old cousin who has a condition called hemiplegia, which means that one side of his body is significantly weaker than the other. He told her he was being teased at school for not being able to do up his pants by himself, and how embarrassed he was. ""I couldn't believe no one had tried to fix that,"" she said. ""But then I realized it was a much bigger problem."" She met with United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and started conducting focus groups. ""I couldn't believe what I was hearing,"" she said. ""Something everyone does -- get dressed and undressed -- should not be a challenge.""

Mr. Razdan had a similar epiphany in 2014, while he was working at an internet start-up following a stint at Goldman Sachs. He noticed that some family members who were wrestling with cancer were walking around with what looked like the ankle section of tube socks on their upper arms. The socks, it turned out, were being used as not particularly attractive covers for peripherally inserted central catheters, semi-permanent intravenous lines in the upper arm. Known as PICC lines, they allow easy vein access for chemotherapy and extended antibiotic administration, among other uses. After his mother, an anesthesiologist, mentioned to a former colleague at Johns Hopkins that her son had an idea to improve the cover, Mr. Razdan teamed up with a friend's wife who had been working at Kensie, a contemporary brand for girls. Together they created what is effectively a brightly colored sleeve, not unlike a truncated version of what runners and basketball players now use, except that it is made with an antimicrobial treatment and comes with a mesh window to make dressings visible and let them breathe. It can be customized in a variety of ways, and makes the wearer look like LeBron James (kind of) instead of a patient. This was followed by shirts -- polo, baseball and a zippered blouse -- that allow for the insertion and removal of central lines and ports, as well as a collaboration with Ms. Jones on gloves made specifically for wheelchair users. (Generally, wheelchair users adapt bicycle or batting gloves for their purposes.) ""What you wear has a profound impact on your psyche,"" Mr. Razdan said. ""It can make you feel like yourself again at a time when it's easy to feel like things are out of your control.""

According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one out of every five adults in the United States has a disability. ""We are all at risk of having a disability at some point in our lifetime,"" Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the agency, said in a news release. ""We think it is a $40 billion industry,"" said Mr. Razdan, who is in talks with a ""big-name designer -- I can't tell you who"" to redesign a hospital gown. More than 580 million people are admitted to hospitals worldwide every year, according to the World Medical Markets Factbook. It all seems so obvious that it's hard not to wonder: What took fashion so long? Fashion, which was once a world defined by exclusivity -- clothes for the very rich, or the very skinny; clothes for insiders, for people who knew where to shop -- has, in recent years, undergone a democratic revolution.

If the doors first opened with Yves Saint Laurent's popularization of high-fashion ready-to-wear in the 1960s, they were thrown wide to the masses at the turn of the millennium with the advent of fast fashion, and the idea that economics should not dictate who has access to cool clothes. From there, it did not take long for the same idea to be applied to size, age, sexuality and religion. Yet solving for the disabled and the displaced has in many ways been the final frontier. Though advances in medical technology and legislation have created situations in which people with long-term conditions are increasingly able to be part of the work force and quotidian life, the implications -- they need clothes that allow them to do so while also accommodating their physical reality -- have taken a while to sink in. Manufacturing has similarly not caught up with reality, and Ms. Jones and Ms. Luna cite issues with nonstandard pattern-cutting and materials (people in wheelchairs, for example, need tops with very truncated bodies but long arms) as roadblocks to wider production. But beyond the practical, there's also a more fundamental issue of what, exactly, fashion is for. Escapism has long been considered by many the point of fashion. Talk to chief executives of catwalk brands and chances are they will go on and on about ""the dream."" Even when fashion has wrestled with real-world issues, it was always in the context of either fund-raising (it has been active with issues like H.I.V./AIDS and breast cancer) or its own traditional forms: John Galliano's controversial ""Homeless"" couture collection for Dior, for example, with newsprint gowns inspired by the men sleeping beside the Seine. When Ms. Luna first became immersed in the refugee crisis, she considered transferring from Parsons to a school with a more traditional international relations program (she even applied to Sciences Po -- the Paris Institute of Political Studies) because she couldn't imagine how what she was learning could be relevant. She didn't have a model to follow.

PVH, the largest shirtmaker in the United States and the owner of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, has teamed up with Ms. Horton to incorporate her technology into its Van Heusen dress shirts. This followed a collaboration she did with Tommy Hilfiger for boys' and girls' shirts for Runway of Dreams, a nonprofit founded in 2013 by a former designer, Mindy Scheier, that works with fashion to create mainstream adaptive clothing. And, though the designer of the year is normally a direct conduit to a job at a major fashion label, Ms. Luna (who had planned to go work at Abercrombie & Fitch before her conversion) and Ms. Jones (who is finishing a year's residency at Eileen Fisher, which she took in part to better understand production concerns) have eschewed that path and are planning to work together to adapt their collections for commercial production. Ms. Luna has trademarked the name of her would-be brand: Adiff (Design for Difference). ""In today's world, we are all asking ourselves how we can play a role in bringing change to problems around us as an individual,"" Mr. Cakmak said. Designers are no longer exempt from that question.","For years, designers responded to social problems by fund-raising. Now they're taking it to a new level.

Music,A Paris Opera Conductor Comes Full Circle,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/arts/music/paris-opera-philippe-jordan.html,"After over a decade as music director of the Paris Opera, the conductor Philippe Jordan is preparing to enter a new phase of his career at the Vienna State Opera. He bids farewell with the same work that won over the French capital's audience in 2010: Wagner's ""Ring."" A new staging of the tetralogy by Calixto Bieito has been scheduled to begin this season and continue in the fall before it unfolds under Mr. Jordan's baton as a mini-festival in November and December. It takes place despite a loss of over 16 million euros ($17 million) because of strikes over retirement reform that forced the company to withdraw two new productions next season. The company has also made available on its website until Sunday a replay of an earlier production of Mozart's ""Don Giovanni,"" which Mr. Jordan was to conduct at Palais Garnier (three other productions were canceled because of the coronavirus outbreak). Until May 3, viewers will also have the opportunity to experience a full cycle of Tchaikovsky symphonies that Mr. Jordan recorded with the house orchestra in 2017-18.

Known as much for his versatility and rigor as an ability to balance the theatrical with musical considerations, the 45-year-old (son of the conductor Armin Jordan) is credited with raising standards in the pit during his Paris tenure. But it is with Wagner perhaps more than any other composer that the Swiss native has made his mark, from noted appearances at the Bayreuth Festival in 2012 to the Metropolitan Opera last year.

Starting this fall, when Mr. Jordan takes over as music director in Vienna, he will devote the bulk of his energy to activities at the State Opera. Alongside the ""Ring,"" he is scheduled to conduct only two concerts in Paris next season (as a further sign of commitment to his new post, he will end his position as principal conductor of the Wiener Symphoniker in 2021). Mr. Jordan said in a telephone interview that ""it is best to leave on a high note"": ""Although I would have been happy to spend another 10 years in Paris -- with this wonderful orchestra, with these two houses, in this wonderful city -- I think I gave everything I could. It is also important to get new stimulation and develop myself further."" The following interview was translated from German. It has been edited and condensed. What qualities does the house orchestra in Paris bring to Wagner, and on what aspects have you worked over the years? Not everyone may share my opinion, but my feeling is that Wagner should not necessarily be played heavy and German. We know that he spent a great deal of time in Paris, which was the mecca of opera culture.

A French orchestra has per se more transparency and clarity than a German orchestra. The winds are more flexible and smoother. But also the strings, since they are not played as intensively, provide an opportunity for the singers not to constantly have to force [their voices]. Nevertheless, one shouldn't work with a French orchestra on French but rather German qualities. They don't lose their French qualities as a result. That was our collaborative work; it developed increasingly into the orchestra's DNA. How has your perspective on the ""Ring"" changed over the years? A lot has changed because I was in Bayreuth in the meantime. One learns there to conduct Wagner differently than one otherwise would -- above all, the ""Ring"" and ""Parsifal."" That lies with the acoustics. The proportions between the woodwinds and horns -- which are usually too loud in the pit -- and the strings are ideally balanced. One gets a very different feeling for the relief of the score. The other thing is the sense of tempo. Most conductors, myself included, tend to bathe themselves in the sound. In Bayreuth, one notices that it doesn't carry if a tempo is too slow. To what extent do you adapt to a given director? A conductor and director have to work with mutual respect. It should always be music theater -- music stands in the foreground -- and nevertheless it should be good theater. I have never worked with Calixto Bieito, but after seeing [his production of Aribert Reimann's] ""Lear"" at Garnier, it was clear to me and Stephane Lissner [director of the Paris Opera] that this is an exciting aesthetic. He is not someone who presents a finished concept that rather brings evocations that result in an overall picture.

I am also very pleased that we are trying to cultivate a new generation of Wagner singers -- not no-names, but people who are fresh. Iain Paterson is still a relatively new Wotan, Martina Serafin a new Brunnhilde. Of course we also have Jonas Kaufmann and Eva-Maria Westbroek, which I am very happy about in ""Die Walkure."" How have you been affected by the strikes? Is this a warning to the rest of Europe? As a foreigner in this country, it is hard for me to offer an opinion. But I stated in a public letter to the culture minister that the higher the retirement age, the more the quality of the musicians suffers. Most of all with instruments like solo horn or solo trumpet or choral singers. One can say that there are such conditions abroad, but I think this is part of the quality that this system guarantees -- that we could always have the best people at the right age. In Vienna, the role of music director is being redefined so that you will be more involved in overall management. What challenges lie ahead there? The challenge is how to manage a repertory company, where one presents up to 60 titles a year. In Paris, it is about 20. How does one deal with the limited rehearsal situation? How does one manage the ensemble?","Philippe Jordan talks about his new role in Vienna and his farewell to Paris: a new staging of Wagner's ""Ring,"" which he conducted there in 2010.",2e427e32-96da-5c62-b9d5-d4931506ad40,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/25/multimedia/25sp-jordan-inyt1/25sp-jordan-inyt1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=545&w=1041&s=0b4872be6afc5399e647e5eba36f38bbbcd1986e29b8c5a88570b495a177062c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Swiss conductor Philippe Jordan with the orchestra of the Paris Opera.,2e427e32-96da-5c62-b9d5-d4931506ad40,Demo_data/D1_imgs/12e427e32-96da-5c62-b9d5-d4931506ad40.jpg,12,10

Opinion,What Do Swing Voters Think? Meet @American__Voter,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/opinion/twitter-democratic-debate.html,"Imagine you've scooted into a red booth in an unfussy local diner somewhere in Michigan, not unlike those portrayed in the numerous articles reporters have dispatched from the Midwest since the 2016 election. One booth over, you're overhearing a middle-aged white man talk about his politics with a buddy of his. You find out over the course of your meal that he's a moderate Democrat who wants to keep Obamacare protections in place and opposes concealed-carry, but who also supports mandatory minimum sentencing and favors deporting illegal immigrants. He also happens to mention that he voted for Donald Trump. This sort of conflicted, ""cross-pressured"" voter often appears in vigorous debates over swing voters in quasi-hypothetical terms. However, we know from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (C.C.E.S.), a nationwide scientific survey, that this aforementioned voter in Michigan is a very real, living, breathing man, who was among the roughly 65,000 Americans asked about their identities, policy preferences and voting behavior by the study.

As researchers, we saw back in 2017, near the start of the Trump presidency, how the voices in online discourse belied the ideological idiosyncrasies of the actual electorate. So we decided to shoehorn that reality right into the belly of the discourse beast by creating a Twitter account called the American Voter Bot, which turns the raw C.C.E.S. data into neat, tweet-length profiles of real-life individual voters' stances on issues. (We posted the code for this on GitHub for anyone to check out.)

Only 17 percent of those who responded to the survey held liberal positions across all seven issues and only 6 percent were conservative across the board, meaning that just 1 in 4 Americans had the perfectly consistent policy views held by each party's most visible politicians and some of the biggest voices online. Our automated bot works by selecting four policy preferences at random for each anonymized voter, who are identified by their age, education, race, gender, home state and 2016 vote choice. Then the bot tweets one profile out with this information every hour, allowing the Democratic electorate that dominates Twitter the chance to e-meet the voters who may be outside of their online bubble. (Among the bot's followers are many ""Twitter famous"" journalists based in elite coastal institutions.)

The bot introduces you to some interesting characters. Take the Floridian white man in his 40s who recently sprouted onto our feed. He says he's conservative, but doesn't feel like he fits with either party. He thinks women should always have the right to choose when to have an abortion, is pro-Obamacare, and wants the federal minimum wage to be $12 an hour. But curiously enough, he's a Trump voter. Why? Well, he opposes the Clean Air Act -- might he have a job in a fossil fuel industry and feel threatened by Democrats' quick embrace of radical environmental policy in light of climate change? Of course, it's not possible to know through a survey. But just by getting a peek at a voter beyond his one ballot can inspire a much more humble reading of the electorate's behavior. You don't need to look much further than the latest far-left-leaning Democratic debate to see how uniform policy preferences have become in our two-party system. The candidates' reluctance to reject purity tests, as well as their attempts to avoid ""getting ratioed"" by their loud online base, often leads them to well-intentioned yet hard-line rhetoric and stances that are unrepresentative of even many Democratic voters. As that party's primary rages on this year, we may need reminders of people like the 59-year-old white woman from Massachusetts we came across who voted for Hillary Clinton three years ago but is a self-described conservative who doesn't think women should always have a right to an abortion. Could a zinger at a town hall that puts down pro-life arguments earn a candidate plaudits online and on MSNBC, but make others like her feel ignored or vilified? Even for the unwaveringly pro-choice, it's a politically handy question to keep in mind.

Over the course of a day, our bot introduced followers to a white moderate Mississippian who opposes Obamacare and supports the Clean Air Act, a 20-year-old non-college-educated Hispanic Trump voter from California, a white woman Clinton voter from Michigan who supports deporting undocumented immigrants, and a pro-choice Republican from North Dakota who didn't vote in 2016. These are certainly all unique combinations. But the ubiquity of this general pattern shows that even as America geographically continues what the journalist Bill Bishop calls ""the Big Sort"" -- where people increasingly live siloed with others who think, act and vote like them -- American voters, and nonvoters, remain complex as a whole.

Naturally, being met face to face with those who you feel bear responsibility for a personally threatening president is an unpleasant reality for many of our followers, who reply to some profiles with anger. In response to one 33-year-old moderate Democrat who didn't vote in 2016, several users commented with variations of ""thanks for nothing."" One self-described liberal who supports raising the minimum wage and opposes deporting undocumented immigrants but somehow ended up voting for Gary Johnson in 2016 led another follower to exclaim in a comment, ""I want to smack him on the side of his head.""",Only 23 percent of adult citizens are either all liberal or all conservative across seven major issues.,f9792301-dada-56f1-a86a-eb6ea6623b0d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/opinion/20alexmorrisWeb/20alexmorrisWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6542e139f7ec6a878a311a4e1f4c43472963a7d6a3ae9356e651b4b97f3c4122&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Trump rally last month in Battle Creek, Mich.

Food,12 Top-Tier (but Undervalued) Burgundy Producers,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/dining/drinks/value-burgundy-wine.html,"Burgundy is glorious. Everybody knows it. And that is a problem. Over the last 20 years, prices for Burgundy, both reds and whites, have rocketed upward as growing demand for the wines has far outrun the supply. Financial trackers might quibble as to whether Bordeaux or Burgundies are the better investments, but ordinary consumers who love to drink Burgundy, not resell it for profit, agree on one thing: Without the resources of a hedge-fund manager, they are mostly out of luck. That is not strictly true. Becky Wasserman, an American wine broker in Beaune who has done more than anybody over the last 40 years to introduce Americans to the best in Burgundy, insists that wonderful wines are available at all prices . She points primarily to lesser-known appellations and regional wines from good producers. And she is right. Even though prices for the best Burgundies are now orbiting the moon, you can still enjoy many bottles at more down-to-earth rates, which, for Burgundy, means under $50.

This is an excellent strategy. Yet it is not always satisfying for anybody who wants to understand Burgundy in its fullest dimension -- which not only encompasses great bottles, but a way of thinking about wine and its meaning that has captured the imagination of people the world over. In this view, every bottle of Burgundy lives somewhere on a spectrum of potential distinctiveness and greatness. At the base lie regional wines, Bourgogne Rouge or Bourgogne Blanc, bottles that have the capacity to represent the general character of Burgundy, but not the intricacy of more specific places. With each step higher, the wines become more coveted and more expensive. A leap up from regional wines are village wines, in which the grapes come from vineyards that express the essence of villages that over time have demonstrated their singular personalities, like Nuits-St.-George, Vosnes-Romanee and Volnay, just to name some of the more famous ones. Next are the premier crus, particularly good vineyards that can amplify distinguishing traits of a village. And at the top are grand crus, in which the character of a vineyard transcends all other categories. These are the exorbitant few, with hallowed names like Chambertin, Musigny and Montrachet. This way of thinking about wine, in which its potential is defined by the place it is grown -- by its terroir -- has influenced almost every great wine region and conscientious winemaker in the world. It has far eclipsed the Bordeaux notion that judges the quality of a producer by the price its wine fetches.

For this reason, wine lovers crave the opportunity to drink Burgundy -- or at minimum to taste it -- at every level, if only to understand the notion of a grand cru in relation to wines judged to have less potential. Wine, and Burgundy, are never that clear-cut. Other variables come into play beyond the vineyard hierarchy: the philosophy and skill of the growers and producers, primarily. Nonetheless, this does not diminish the desire to try the foremost examples, at least a few times. Let's stipulate that the best Burgundies, the premier crus and grand crus, are going to be exorbitant. But the level of exorbitance rises with the most famous and most exalted producers, legendary names like Romanee-Conti and Leroy, Rousseau and Roumier, Leflaive and Coche-Dury, Lafon and Roulot. The good news is that Burgundy is full of less-heralded great producers, those whose names do not yet make the wines too expensive to drink. They would still be a splurge for most people -- $100, say, for a premier cru bottle, but the equivalent from a more heralded producer might cost twice that. These producers may be young and new, or perhaps they took over an underperforming family estate. Some may not have access to the most illustrious terroirs, but do great work with what they have. Others may not be able to afford to own vineyards, so they buy grapes. None of these names are truly under the radar. The world's molecular obsession with Burgundy does not permit that. But for whatever reason, in my opinion, they offer good value relative to the more celebrated names, and exceptional insight into what makes good Burgundy so revered.

Since Cyprien Arlaud took over his family estate and moved to biodynamic viticulture, the freshness, finesse and purity of the wines has improved noticeably. Arlaud, based in Morey-St.-Denis, makes a wide range of Cote de Nuits reds, with fine choices in village, premier cru and grand cru. Aside from the estate wines, good negociant wines are labeled Cyprien Arlaud. (Skurnik Wines, New York) This domaine, run by Charles Ballot, is based in Meursault and specializes in white wines that are racy, energetic and fine, rather than extravagant and sumptuous. There are also some very good reds from Volnay. (Polaner Selections, Mount Kisco, N.Y.) The Bize domaine is well known, yet the wines almost always seem to be reasonably priced in the context of other Burgundies , with village wines starting around $50. Perhaps this is because the terroirs, both white and red, of Savigny-les-Beaune, its home territory, are not universally esteemed. Regardless, the wines are graceful, limpid and entrancing, and I almost always love them. (Grand Cru Selections, New York) The proprietors, the de Nicolay family, make natural, pure, delicious whites and reds that reward aging. They do make grand cru Cortons, both white and red, but most of their production is village and premier crus from Savigny-les-Beaune, Pernand-Vergelesses and Aloxe-Corton. The reds are spicy and expressive. Highly recommended. (David Bowler Wine, New York) This negociant, the husband-and-wife team of Guillaume Bott and Tomoko Kuriyama, dates back only to 2010, has its roots in Simon Bize and is likewise based in Savigny-les-Beaune. Its wines, whites and reds, are gorgeously transparent, fresh and unadorned. They are excellent values. (Grand Cru Selections) Here is a prime example of a wonderful grower and producer who is underestimated because he does not have access to the great terroirs. Jean-Philippe Fichet is based in Meursault. He makes a number of white wines from specific village terroirs like Le Tesson and Les Gruyaches that are distinctive enough to have their own names but are not judged to be premier cru. Regardless, they are lovely wines that burst with energy and linearity. (Polaner Selections)

This fourth-generation family domaine owns vineyards throughout the Cote d'Or, the heart of Burgundy. It is not well known, but the wines, both whites and reds, are exceptionally true to their terroirs, and are good values. (Grand Cru Selections) Benjamin Leroux does not come from a winemaking family, and so inherited no vines. After managing Domaine du Comte Armand, a fine Pommard estate, for many years, he struck out on his own as a micronegociant making small quantities of wine from up and down the Cote d'Or. Mr. Leroux is a thoughtful, questing winemaker whose aim is to understand each parcel of land with which he works. The wines are terrific examples of their terroirs. (Verity Wine Partners, New York)

Over the years I've had many wonderful wines from the father-daughter team of Pierre and Anne Morey, and yet this estate, based in Meursault, remains one of Burgundy's most underrated. Perhaps it's because the wines are understated and seemingly modest. Still, both the red and the whites, from regional to grand cru, are exquisite and beautifully calibrated. The fine negociant wines are labeled Morey-Blanc. (Grand Cru Selections) I hesitate to mention this estate because the wines are hard to find. But they are so fresh and seductive, both reds and whites from village and premier cru sites in Beaune, that they are worth seeking out. Mr. Rateau farms biodynamically, which is no longer news in Burgundy, but it was when he began in 1979. This commitment shows up in the wines as well. (Fruit of the Vines, New York) Alexandrine Roy took over her family estate at a young age, yet the wines under her direction have shown uncommon precision and depth. This estate, based in Gevrey-Chambertin, owns only village terroirs, but the wines are superb examples of the depth that even village Gevrey-Chambertin can offer. (Skurnik Wines) Unlike Domaine Marc Roy, Domaine Trapet has holdings in some of Gevrey-Chambertin's finest terroirs, including the grand cru vineyards Chambertin, Chappelle-Chambertin and Latriciere-Chambertin. These are all excellent wines: fine, elegant and aromatic, concentrated but never weighty.

Style,The Leotard Queen,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/style/best-leotards-for-dancers.html,"""What you wear doesn't make you a better dancer, but it can make you a more confident dancer,"" said Sarah Chun, a first soloist with Northern Ballet in Leeds, England. Here she is shown practicing in a leotard from Eleve Dancewear.



KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- ""We're very self-conscious about our bodies, and we're fighting that every day."" So said Misa Kuranaga, a principal dancer with the San Francisco Ballet, one day in December by phone. She was in the midst of rehearsing the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy for the annual ""Nutcracker"" production and ruminating on the importance of leotards. As she spoke, Ms. Kuranaga was wearing a leotard with a mesh top and mock turtleneck, and a patterned body that began just at the breastbone. ""What you wear doesn't make you a better dancer, but it can make you a more confident dancer,"" said Sarah Chun, a first soloist with Northern Ballet in Leeds, England, via Skype a few days later. ""If you're not having the best morning, but you're wearing something that you like, and you look at yourself in the mirror you think, 'Oh yeah, I've got this.'"" When it comes to workout wear, leggings and tank tops tend to get all the attention, but leotards, once a favorite of the aerobics crew and the essential everyday wardrobe of the professional dancer, could be making a comeback thanks to the popularity of ballet classes as exercise regimens.

And when it comes to leotards, many dancers have begun to favor a small brand from Kansas City, Mo., Eleve Dancewear. It sells premade styles, but its specialty is custom work that can address (and ameliorate) insecurities around one's body. Eleve offers about 60 styles, and once you factor in all the permutations of fabrics, fit and more, there are millions of possibilities. Eleve's founder, Lisa Choules, 48, understands her market intuitively, as she is a former dancer. ""I was self-conscious, especially coming back after two kids,"" she said. ""I was tall at 5-8, with a long, thin body, but I was busty. So I'd have to buy a medium leotard for the length, but it was so wide, I'd get this weird bubble out the back and it was not flattering at all.""

She began cutting up secondhand leotards to use as patterns, and started making her own, relying on sewing skills she had picked up from her mother, and during high school, when she studied at Utah Regional Ballet. Ms. Choules chose bright colors and prints for her own practice wear. Then, ""when I came to Kansas City Ballet after having my kids, people asked, 'Can you make me a leotard, too?'"" she said. ""I sent a few to friends in other companies. I'd make a handful and sell them to the summer students that came into town if I needed money."" She retired from KCB at 37, wrote a business plan, and applied for a grant from Career Transitions for Dancers, receiving enough money to spend a summer at the Fashion Institute of Technology studying drawing, draping and pattern drafting. Back in Kansas City, she rearranged her basement for more efficient production, and built a website that allowed dancers to custom configure leotards, choosing from a library of about 40 fabrics -- far more than most rival brands, which typically offered leotards in black, white and a handful of solid, and restrained, colors. When one of her former KCB corps members, Stephanie Greenwald, moved to Germany to dance with Staatsballett Berlin, Ms. Choules sent her boxes of leotards. Ms. Greenwald picked out a few for herself, sold the rest and sent the money back to Kansas City. Suddenly, Eleve was international. The Staatsballett toured Japan, and ""we did all kinds of fun prints and mesh, and we were very colorful,"" Ms. Choules said. ""The Japanese girls loved them. We had a huge Japanese following from the beginning.""

A couple of years ago, Ms. Choules and her husband bought a 10,000-square-foot building in midtown Kansas City, and expanded to about 35 employees. All custom orders are made there, as is part of a recently added ready-to-wear line that is sold more than 100 stores around the world. Notwithstanding her purchase of a Gerber DCS2500 computer-controlled cutting table, most of the manufacturing is still done by hand on industrial straight-stitch, serger, and cover-stitch machines for better stretch and durability. Custom leotards start at $67 and can run to more than $100. ""We wear multiple leotards a day, depending on what we're doing and if we're sweating a lot,"" said Abigail Sheppard, a first soloist with the Finnish National Ballet, who has worn Eleve since 2014. ""It's important that they last, because dancers don't make much money."" Kansas City had a thriving garment district from the early 1920s until after World War II, but now there are few skilled sewers in the local labor market, so virtually all Eleve's sewers are immigrants; many are refugees from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. One of the few men in the atelier is a human Rosetta stone, translating instructions into Farsi and Dari; Pashto, Urdu and Hindi. Other sewers come from Central America, Syria, China and Bhutan.",The dance world's secret workout weapon is poised to go mainstream.,e527f50f-0a35-5f80-9393-7c4757b19a49,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/19/fashion/17LeotardLady-2/17LeotardLady-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=ea03b81323df29035d0fadf45996ff7cad625e565c3e4ee4f23ef30ca8ef85ba&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lisa Choules, the founder of Elevé Dancewear and a former dancer herself, standing among shelves of fabric in her atelier in Kansas City, Mo.",e527f50f-0a35-5f80-9393-7c4757b19a49,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1e527f50f-0a35-5f80-9393-7c4757b19a49.jpg,15,6
Fashion & Style,Adidas and Kanye West: What Did Everyone Expect?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/fashion/kanye-west-adidas.html,"The petition is up and the Twitterati are awake. This week Adidas became the latest apparel brand to come under fire for what a celebrity collaborator said, after Kanye West gave an interview to TMZ in which he said he thought 400 years of slavery ""sounds like a choice."" The internet clutched its collective bosom and began to roar. He tried to walk it back, or at least explain on social media what he really meant, but the damage had been done. Amid the torrent of words and controversial statements that have spewed forth from the volcano of his mouth and mind recently -- and there have been a lot, starting with the Trump-love -- this was the part that the self-appointed consumer watchdogs of the digital world could not countenance. As they did whenever they felt a brand has made a mistake, whether with a product (H&M and its monkey hoodie), or a statement (Laura Ingraham and her comments on a Parkland survivor), or a video (PewDiePie), they made their displeasure known. But this time around Adidas hasn't done what pretty much every other big brand has done until now: apologize and cut off the offending limb. Or at least it hasn't yet.

Kasper Rorsted, the brand's chief executive, has repeatedly said that while he doesn't support Mr. West's comments, they are Mr. West's comments, and though Adidas's position on human rights was public and firm (and not in alignment with Mr. West's statement), he was not going to comment further on Mr. West. Mr. Rorsted also went on to acknowledge that Mr. West, along with other Adidas collaborators such as Pharrell Williams and Stella McCartney, was a big help in the brand's comeback in the United States. Maybe that's part of it. And maybe Adidas, not being an American company, does not understand the freighted, painful nature of Mr. West's remarks (though presumably their local team does). But I would guess there's something else going on, too. Think about it: Could Adidas really not have anticipated the likelihood of something like this happening when they signed Mr. West lo, those many moons ago (in 2013)? Not, to be sure, the slavery comments exactly -- but something that would upset or alienate a large chunk of the consumer population, something that would be so offensive to a meaningful group of people that it would become a debating point across the public conversation? It's hard to imagine a world where that scenario hadn't come up. Controversy and loose-cannon-ism, speaking off the cuff and without a filter (or seemingly any real forethought), has always been part of the Kanye West brand; part of his appeal and extraordinary hubris and the magnet draw that is a combination of great talent and the constant threat of a train wreck.

He's endlessly saying the things other people could never even imagine thinking. You never really know what bizarro thing is going to come out of his mouth (or fingers) next. It is the bedrock on which part of his reputation rests. It's not a secret. It's addictive. That's what he does: He goes too far. Unlike, say, such spokespeople-that-went-wrong as Ryan Lochte, who was dropped by Speedo and Polo Ralph Lauren after the swimmer admitted he lied about being robbed during the Rio Olympics, or Maria Sharapova, whose deals with Nike and Porsche were suspended after she failed a drug test (they later renewed their agreements), Mr. West never pretended to be other than what he was: someone who could not, as he tweeted recently, be ""managed.""

Adidas couldn't argue -- none of us can -- that it was suckered into thinking he stood for a politically correct, modern moralistic approach to the world. This is not to defend or excuse what he said; it was reprehensible. But it was also, at an abstract level, in character. When Adidas hired Mr. West, after all, he had already jumped onstage at the 2009 MTV video awards to announce Taylor Swift did not deserve the ""Best Female Video"" award and it should have gone to Beyonce. He was engaged in something of a public war with his previous sneaker partner, Nike (he eventually wrote a song about it). He wasn't crocheting lace doilies for the sofa. Adidas knew what it was getting into. The brand hired him because of his ability to draw attention and incite emotions, not in spite of it.

It wasn't, let's be honest (and whatever he may claim) because he's such a genius sneaker designer. Unlike his music, there's nothing groundbreaking or industry-shifting about Mr. West's apparel or his footwear. They don't stand on their own. The content of the clothing is him. His ego -- the one that allowed him to have a fashion show in Madison Square Garden and claim he should be designing for Hermes -- and his messianic sense of self fills the product with meaning for his consumers. And they buy it in sell-out numbers. He's right about that. Or upsets his consumers. Which sometimes in Mr. West's case can seem like one and the same. It would be hypocritical if Adidas were to drop him now, especially at a time when another out-of-control Tweeter is setting the national agenda. Dropping him might in the end do more damage to the company's reputation than if it gives into public pressure. It's possible this position could shift; it's possible Mr. West could double down to such an extent that it would be untenable for the relationship to continue. And Adidas has punished him a little: Contrary to Mr. West's claims that he is the biggest thing to hit the sneaker market since man was created, Mr. Rorsted told CNBC that the Yeezy brand has been important to Adidas but it is ""a small part"" of the $25 billion company. Besides, if consumers really want Adidas to cut ties with Kanye, all they have to do is stop buying the product and make it an even smaller part. That's the real way to effect change in a company that is reliant on purchasing. But, as of Friday morning, there were 13,407 signatures on this ""Drop Kanye"" petition. Mr. West has 28.2 million Twitter followers. You do the math.",The company is standing by the artist after his controversial comments on slavery. The internet is up in arms.

Science,Sierra Nevada Snow Won't End California's Thirst,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/12/science/california-snow-drought-sierra-nevada-water.html,"YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- Thanks in part to El Nino, snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is greater than it has been in years. With the winter snowfall season winding down, California officials said that the pack peaked two weeks ago at 87 percent of the long-term average. That's far better than last year, when it was just 5 percent of normal and Gov. Jerry Brown announced restrictions on water use after four years of severe drought. But the drought is still far from over, especially in Southern California, where El Nino did not bring many major storms. Despite the better news this year, there are plenty of worrying signs about the Sierra snowpack, which provides about 30 percent of the water Californians use after it melts and flows into rivers and reservoirs, according to the state Department of Water Resources.

""We'll be getting more rain and less snow here,"" said Roger C. Bales, a professor at the University of California, Merced, and a principal investigator with the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory, which studies snowpack and other water-related issues. ""That means less snowpack storage and faster runoff."" Dr. Bales was standing on a snowy slope in Yosemite last Thursday, at about 7,000 feet elevation, just off a 19th-century wagon road that is used by hikers and snowshoers. Nearby, amid car-size granite boulders and close to a soaring Ponderosa pine, were instruments that he and his fellow researchers use to obtain detailed information about the snowpack in several spots throughout the southern Sierra.

Proof was close at hand, as well. Until the last quarter-mile of a two-mile hike here from 6,300 feet, snowshoes were not needed. What snow remained was in small patches. Similar effects of climate change have been seen throughout the Sierra, including at the Central Sierra Snow Laboratory, which is operated by the University of California at Berkeley near the Donner Pass, about 120 miles to the north. Researchers there still make some measurements the way they have since the lab started in the 1940s, by inserting special metal tubes into the snow.

""We are seeing an ever-increasing percentage of annual and winter precipitation in liquid rather than solid form,"" said Randall Osterhuber, who spends winters at the lab. The altitude above which snow accumulates is becoming higher as temperatures warm. ""That change in elevation means a lot less terrain is covered in snow."" Climate change is also expected to increase precipitation in some areas, because warmer air can hold more moisture. But it is not yet clear if that will be the case in the Sierra Nevada. Snowpack is measured in ""snow water equivalent,"" or how much water would result if the snow were melted. When snow first falls in the Sierra, it is usually dry and powdery, with about 10 to 12 percent moisture by volume, but as it accumulates and compresses, the moisture content rises to about 40 percent. So 30 inches of snow on March 30 would be equivalent to about 12 inches of water.

The data from Dr. Bales's instruments will not be downloaded until later in the spring, but just up the slope, other instruments set up by the Department of Water Resources send data continuously to state offices in Sacramento. Last Thursday, they recorded a water equivalent of 18.36 inches. With warm spring temperatures, the snowpack here was past its peak, with the water equivalent declining by more than three inches in less than two weeks. The Department of Water Resources instruments are set up in a relatively open part of the forest. The observatory's instruments, by contrast, are near the Ponderosa pine, and there are three of them: one next to the trunk, one a little farther away where water drips from the tips of the branches, and one in the open, about 20 feet away. Other sensors, which are buried, detect how much water is in the ground. The goal is to gather a complete picture of the snowpack, which is far from a uniform blanket of white. A tree, for example can affect snow cover in several ways, Dr. Bales said. Some snow is caught by the branches and turns directly to vapor. Other flakes melt and the water drips to the ground. The tree trunk itself absorbs sunlight and re-emits it as heat, melting the snow around it. Boulders do the same thing. Even the tiniest pieces of forest litter -- needles or bits of pine cones -- can heat up in the sunlight and cause melting.

""We're strategically sampling the landscape,"" Dr. Bales said. ""We pretty much know what topographic features affect snowpack."" That will give water managers a truer understanding of how much water the snowpack will generate. Trees also affect the amount of water stored in the mountains simply by growing, sucking up water from the ground. Some of it is used in photosynthesis, but much of it is lost through evaporation and transpiration through the leaves and stems. Dr. Bales and his colleagues study this, too, with instruments atop towers that measure the flow of water vapor from the tree canopy. The scientists learned that a lot of water was lost through the trees -- more than was even thought to be there in some cases. ""That told us the precipitation estimates that people had for higher elevations were just plain wrong,"" Dr. Bales said.

Warmer temperatures also mean that trees grow faster, and don't necessarily shut down for the winter. Thus they use more of the melting snow, and over a longer period. That leaves less water to flow into streams and down to reservoirs. Less snow, earlier melting and faster growth mean that more trees are running out of water in the summer. Mohammad Safeeq, a colleague of Dr. Bales at the university, said that, in general, water was flowing off the mountains two weeks earlier than in the past. ""Two weeks in a three-month summer window is significant,"" he said. Water-stressed trees are more susceptible to pests and disease, so one result of the changes is more tree deaths. This is readily apparent at Yosemite in the drive from the valley floor, where the green hillsides are dotted -- in some cases in large numbers -- with the brown of dead pines and firs. Contributing to the problem is the fact that there are many more trees here than there used to be. A century ago, Dr. Safeeq said, Yosemite had perhaps 20 trees an acre; now the number is closer to 100. That means more of the melting snowpack never gets off the mountain to the valley below, he said. The greater number of trees is due in part to years of forest agency policies under which small natural fires were quickly extinguished to protect homes and other property in the mountains. But smaller, less intense fires are nature's way of thinning the forest, culling trees that are less fire-resistant, said Martha H. Conklin, a Merced professor and another principal investigator with the observatory. Paradoxically, because fire suppression leaves so much timber on the mountains, it can lead to much bigger and hotter fires, like the Rim Fire that burned 250,000 acres in and around Yosemite and destroyed more than 100 structures in 2013. Fire suppression is a controversial subject in California. But thinning the forest by letting small fires run their course would increase snowpack because more of the snow would reach the ground, and less of the water would be taken up by the trees. That could be, in effect, like adding an entire new reservoir of water in the mountains, rather than building a new billion-dollar reservoir down in the valley.",Climate change and the proliferation of trees have led to less of a natural reservoir of melting snow coming down the mountains.,67f7054a-f83a-5d10-95c2-9953e27e99b9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/12/science/12SNOWPACK-web/12SNOWPACK5-1460405398367-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=07b281da305dc616801075dd11894ffbd89740dadb1fd10ec916bc90748122b1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Snow partially covered the Sierra Nevada in central California in 2016.,67f7054a-f83a-5d10-95c2-9953e27e99b9,Demo_data/D1_imgs/167f7054a-f83a-5d10-95c2-9953e27e99b9.jpg,2,20
Books,Jesus Died Only to Rise Again. Where Did the Concept of the Resurrection Come From?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/books/review/resurrection-jesus.html,"The resulting outpouring of religious enthusiasm, with its attendant civil unrest and threat to the existing order, would have been the last thing Pilate needed. He was uninterested in theological disputes among the Jews; his task was to keep his territory in check. As the Jewish historian Josephus wrote, it was ""on these festive occasions that sedition is most apt to break out."" The elements for chaos were all there. ""Jesus teaches in the Temple courtyard; the excited pilgrim crowds collect there,"" Fredriksen writes. ""In the intensity of their expectation -- that the kingdom was literally about to arrive? That Jesus was about to be revealed as messiah? That the restoration of Israel was at hand? -- they are restive, potentially incendiary.""

Thus, for reasons of governance, not theology or divinely ordained fate, Pilate (not the high priests, who had no such authority) sentenced Jesus to death. It was a signal -- crucifixion being the most public kind of execution, with the cross as a vivid warning to those able to see -- not to challenge Rome. On the Friday of Passover, Fredriksen writes, ""the pilgrim throng would have streamed out of the city to the hill just outside, to the Place of the Skull, Golgotha. There they would have beheld the man, dying on a cross. ... As far as Pilate was concerned, that was the end of the matter.""

But of course it wasn't. As N. T. Wright, the prolific biblical scholar and a former Anglican bishop of Durham, England, relates in his 2003 book, ""The Resurrection of the Son of God,"" the story in many ways really begins when Jesus' female disciples find the empty tomb on Sunday morning. According to the Gospel of Luke, the male disciples at first treated the women's report as ""an idle tale,"" and ""did not believe them""; the Gospel of John says of Jesus' followers, ""for as yet they did not understand ... that he must rise from the dead.""

They dismissed the first report of the Resurrection because they'd been expecting a different new reality. They were still, in the painful hours after the Passion, crushed that their messiah, far from leading the forces of God to victory over the Romans, had instead been mocked and murdered. It was only in the shocked aftermath of the Crucifixion, of the empty tomb and of the post-Resurrection appearances, that the first followers seem to have worked out what it all meant. As late as the writings of Paul, believers held that a ""Parousia,"" or apocalyptic Second Coming, was imminent. In this view, Jesus, rather than ushering in the kingdom as one of their number -- the expectation before the Crucifixion -- would return to earth at any hour and set things to rights. This never happened, leaving the disciples and their heirs in the decades after Jesus to construct an enduring faith for a world that would not end. They then recalled -- or believed they recalled -- words of Jesus (along with miracles such as the raising from the dead of Lazarus, Jairus' daughter and the son of the widow of Nain) that seemed to foreshadow the Resurrection and its significance.

For Wright, the Easter story is not only theologically but historically true. In part, the mystification of the disciples -- presumably the ones who would have spirited away the corpse if it were all a hoax -- is, from this perspective, the most compelling evidence of the accuracy of the events reported in the Gospels. So singular was the proposition that a particular person had been resurrected from the dead and that belief in him would lead to eternal salvation; it would hardly have been the early Christians' first choice of narratives to share.

Health,HPV Vaccine Expanded for People Ages 27 to 45,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/health/hpv-virus-vaccine-cancer.html,"The HPV vaccine, which prevents cervical cancer and other malignancies, is now approved for men and women from 27 to 45-years-old, the Food and Drug Administration said on Friday. The vaccine is Gardasil 9, made by Merck, and had been previously approved for minors and people up to age 26. It works against the human papillomavirus, HPV, which can also cause genital warts and cancers of the vulva, anus, penis and parts of the throat. The virus has many strains. It is sexually transmitted, and most adults encounter at least one strain at some point in their lives. The vaccine protects against nine strains, including those most likely to cause cancers and genital warts. ""Today's approval represents an important opportunity to help prevent HPV-related diseases and cancers in a broader age range,"" Dr. Peter Marks, director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.

The approval was based on a study in women ages 27 to 45, showing that an earlier version of the vaccine was highly effective in preventing persistent HPV infection, genital warts, vulvar and vaginal precancers, cervical precancers and cervical cancers related to the virus types covered by the vaccine. The vaccine's effectiveness in men ages 27 to 45 is inferred from the data in women, from its efficacy in younger men and from evidence that it created immunity in a study of men 27 to 45-years-old. The most common side effects of the vaccine include soreness at the injection site, swelling, redness and headaches. If a person has already been exposed to a particular strain of HPV, the vaccine will not work against that strain. For that reason, vaccination has been strongly recommended for young people before they become sexually active. But even someone who has already been exposed to a few strains -- but not to all nine in the vaccine -- can still gain protection against the strains they have not encountered.

""This is great,"" Dr. Lois M. Ramondetta, a professor of gynecologic oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said in an interview. ""It's a prevention vaccine. The best time to get it is before you turn 13 and have any intimate activity at all. But, that said, it protects against nine types of HPV, so if you have one of the types, you still can be protected from other HPV types."" She added: ""There is a whole generation of people we were missing who didn't know about it. Doctors weren't good at talking about it."" She and Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said people over 26 began asking doctors about the vaccine. Some were leaving marriages or monogamous relationships, expected to begin dating and realized they might be exposed to the virus. ""They want to feel protected to some extent,"" Dr. Ramondetta said. ""Now they have the opportunity."" Younger people need two shots, but the older ones will need three, spaced a few months apart. Dr. Ramondetta noted that tumors affecting part of the throat -- called oropharyngeal cancers -- caused by HPV are rising, particularly in men. The vaccine is believed to help prevent them. Dr. Schaffner said a panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already been discussing the data on using the vaccine in older people, and is expected to make a recommendation about it. The recommendation could be universal, meaning that everyone in that age range should receive it, or it could be ""permissive,"" meaning that the decision is up to doctors and patients. Once that group, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, recommends a vaccine, insurers generally cover it.","The Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of Gardasil 9, a vaccine against nine strains of the human papillomavirus for older age groups.",b643a654-f811-5a73-8961-e1fecb680215,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/29/science/06HPVVACCINE/06HPVVACCINE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=751b4528b30e91360360c08a6e550a99996acd35d6f886c9d20fe2c236204da2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"About 14 million women and men become infected with the human papillomavirus each year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",b643a654-f811-5a73-8961-e1fecb680215,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1b643a654-f811-5a73-8961-e1fecb680215.jpg,1,1
Travel,Remember the 'Travel Bubble'? Here's How It Burst,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/travel/international-travel-bubbles-coronavirus.html,"One of the strategies for keeping international travel afloat during the pandemic was the creation of ""travel bubbles"": alliances between neighboring nations with low infection rates that would allow travelers from those countries to freely visit. But as the summer draws to a close and infections continue to pop up, it appears that, in many places, the travel bubble has burst. There was a lot riding on the alliances. The pause on international tourism doesn't just spoil family vacations; it affects the global economy in profound ways, too. The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that about one in 10 jobs are related to tourism and travel. For popular destinations like Greece, where the tourism sector is responsible for about 40 percent of jobs, the effect is even more significant. Where have the bubbles burst? In May, New Zealand and Australia garnered attention when they announced a plan to create one of the first travel partnerships during the pandemic. The ""Trans-Tasman bubble"" would allow citizens of each country to travel to the other without a quarantine or a test. The hope was to enact it by early September, but in early August, a coronavirus outbreak in the Australian state of Victoria put those plans on hold.

For a while, Europe seemed to represent the best hope for getting tourism going, and it began with the bubble concept. On May 15, the Baltic States of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania created the first travel bubble in Europe; later that month, Hungary and Slovenia agreed that their citizens could continue to travel between the two countries. Soon, much of Europe became a giant bubble. The European Commission created ""Re-open EU,"" a site listing travel rules within European countries. Each member country began easing restrictions at its own pace. Italy and Germany for example, opened quickly to travelers arriving from inside the European Union or the border-free Schengen zone. Britain also began opening up to its neighbors. The welcome mat wasn't rolled out long, though. Flare-ups of the virus caused borders to shut on short notice, disrupting travelers' plans. In late July, Britain abruptly announced that travelers returning from Spain would have to self-quarantine for 14 days, just a few weeks after it had opened restriction-free travel to the country. In mid-August, British vacationers in France had to either rush home to beat newly announced restrictions, or face two weeks of quarantine when they returned.

While some countries jointly announced agreed-upon travel bubbles with neighbors, others created de facto ones by publishing lists of which nearby countries' residents were allowed in and under what circumstances. In the United States, which accounts for about 25 percent of the world's cases, some states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have created their own de facto bubbles, stipulating that travelers coming from a long list of states with a seven-day rolling average of positive tests greater than 10 percent, or number of positive cases over 10 per 100,000 residents, self-isolate on arrival for 14 days. The idea of bubbles created between neighboring countries has given way in recent months to ""travel corridors"" and safe lists, sets of countries and territories around the world whose residents, depending on their destinations, don't have to self-isolate, unless they are showing symptoms of the virus or have recently been exposed. These travel regulations are posted on government websites, such as Re-Open EU and the Centers for Disease Control website, and change as new information is received.

For example, as of Aug. 21 at midnight, travelers arriving in Norway from newly named ""red"" status places, including Austria, Greece, Ireland and Britain, were required to go into quarantine. Britain's website, which lists more than 60 countries and territories from which travelers can visit without self-isolating, removed Croatia and Austria from that list last week and added Portugal. Belgium's foreign affairs website updates the list of restrictions for travelers from various countries each day at 4 p.m. The sites also list countries' virus-testing requirements for travelers. Some nations recommend arriving with evidence of a negative result and offer tests at the airport or 14-day self-quarantines as an alternative. Others, like the United States, which recently dropped its advice that newly arrived travelers quarantine for two weeks, don't require testing to enter the country. Rather than prohibit all travelers from higher risk countries, Greece recently began requiring that people entering from a specified list of locations arrive with a negative test result for Covid-19, performed within three days of their entry.

What could go wrong? The risk is high both for travelers and the countries they are visiting, said Dr. Brad Connor, the New York City site director for the GeoSentinel emerging infectious disease surveillance network of the C.D.C. and a longtime travel medicine and infectious disease specialist. Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic travelers carrying the virus can inadvertently bring it into an area undetected and cause an outbreak for which there is no vaccine and no reliable treatment, Dr. Connor said. ""We all want to travel again in a safe way,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, the approaches so far have not worked."" Infection waves can be local and some countries' restrictions get down to regional specifications. Belgium's list recommends testing and quarantine for travelers arriving from certain areas within other European Union countries, like the southwest regions of Bulgaria. Norway declared that the region of Norrbotten in Sweden, which has fewer Covid cases than most other areas in the country, will be changed on its list from ""red"" to ""yellow,"" and anyone entering Norway from there will not be required to go into quarantine. Cordoning off an area of the country for international tourists is the latest idea aimed at preserving a portion of this year's tourism revenues. Thailand is considering a new program where international travelers who are willing to stay for 30 days are allowed into Phuket, where they will quarantine in specified resorts and undergo two Covid-19 tests. The island of Anguilla in the Caribbean, which said it had no current virus cases, recently announced it would begin welcoming travelers who must apply to visit, giving preference to those from countries with lower infection rates and those who plan an extended stay. Travelers must arrive with evidence of a recent test showing they do not carry the virus. They will also need to quarantine for 10 to 14 days when they arrive, undergo two more virus tests and pay a fee for these services. The web portal states that ""Anguilla is open for approved visitors from certain countries."" Most countries now realize that they can't plan too far in advance. The government website of Norway advises citizens that it ""is not possible for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to say when the travel advice for countries outside Europe will be changed."" Travelers can continue to minimize risk to themselves and others with masks, hand-washing and social distancing -- ""but at this point we can't completely eliminate the risk,"" Dr. Connor said. ""And therein lies the problem.""","To keep tourism afloat during the pandemic, some countries formed travel alliances with their neighbors. At summer's end, the experiment has had mixed results.",33b8ddbe-be28-5985-bf99-90ded414c429,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/28/travel/28travel-bubble2/28travel-bubble2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=2a119ca84c8062263d45eb78f6ff04af873873b1eaa2f916f1151e143c6861be&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An Australia-New Zealand travel bubble, proposed in May, would have allowed citizens of each country to travel to the other without a quarantine or a test.

Theater,"Review: In 'Ordinary Days,' a Sweet Escape to the Recent Past",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/theater/ordinary-days-review.html,"But Claire (Whitney Bashor) has a deep-seated grief that Jason knows nothing about. It comes between them, but a problem of this lopsided production is that their relationship doesn't seem worth rooting for. With their lack of chemistry, breaking up seems the wise course. And while Ms. Bashor does a beautiful job with her big number, the haunted ""I'll Be Here,"" Claire and Jason never come fully to life.

The other love story, though, is delightful to watch. It's the romance of new friendship between Deb and Warren, which blossoms despite her standoffish resistance. Even before they meet, Ms. Marion (in her New York stage debut) and Mr. Sherman make these two refugees from the Island of Misfit Toys achingly endearing.

Warren, in a bright, color-block wardrobe that would look at home on a preschooler (costumes are by Jennifer Paar), is so earnest and unsophisticated -- like Kenneth the Page from ""30 Rock,"" but without the creepiness -- that you worry for him. Won't the city squash him flat?

Deb, too, is more banged up than she wants the world to know, and anger is her shield. ""I am not a negative person,"" she insists in her first song, but we already know she is; that's part of her aggressive, malcontent charm. When she loses the book containing her thesis research, Warren finds it and becomes convinced that they are destined to be friends.

""I sensed from your notebook your fiery nature,"" he sings. ""Your penmanship crackles with rage.""

Meaning it as a compliment, he's too smitten to grasp how invasive he's been. But he sees Deb for who she is, and eventually she'll come around.

Television,"'Billions' Season 4, Episode 8: Raging Bulls",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/arts/television/billions-recap.html,"This week, ""Billions"" staged a charity boxing match between its fake-tough traders. I'm surprised that it took this long for the show to get in the ring. The mano a mano match between Dollar Bill and Mafee on behalf of their overlords, Bobby Axelrod and Taylor Mason, provides the show with a perfect symbol. On the surface the fight is an act of philanthropy, a way to turn competition between rival firms into something productive. And surface is all it is. The perfunctory noblesse oblige of the match's charitable component disguises the venal truth. Two rich men who can barely muster the strength to swing at each other enact an absurd grudge match while their colleagues gamble obscene amounts of money. The winning bet, it turns out, is on both competitors losing. On ""Billions,"" there's always a way to make money off someone else's misfortune. Meanwhile, the real competition takes place before the bout even starts. Wielding every carrot and stick he and Chuck could get their hands on, Bobby has induced the governor to reverse New York's fracking ban. Having bet big on the energy sector, Axe Cap's payoff will be huge.

But the windfall headed Taylor Mason's way is even bigger. Through two combative appearances on CNBC's ""Halftime Report,"" Mason goads Axe into spending substantial political and actual capital on reversing the ban. Bobby takes the bait, hoping to hurt both the pocketbook and the public reputation of his hated rival. But by quietly buying up the rights to the water without which no fracking can actually take place -- for a song, at that -- Mason Cap has positioned itself to emerge from the fracas an even bigger winner. Bobby, meanwhile, is left to feel like a fool who fell for his former underling's ruse, hook, line and sinker. ""I see that taking credit for my success in the midst of defeat is a kind of balm,"" Taylor sneers when Bobby tries to save face by saying he made Mason's win possible. ""So you go on ahead."" That's gotta sting. (Helping his billionaire girlfriend, Rebecca Cantu, gain control of the department-store chain she dreamed about as a small-town kid soothes it a little, I'm sure.) Will Bobby learn anything from this? Certainly not morally. He'll be more wary of tangling with Taylor head-on next time, the same way Taylor learned to be both more cautious and more vicious from the Axe-induced debacle that destroyed the Mason family last week. But the vendetta will continue, even redouble. It always does. Some characters even wage that war on spec. Consider Sarah (Samantha Mathis), Mason Cap's major-domo. Given explicit orders to leave Wendy Rhoades alone, regardless of the role she played in destroying George Mason's dreams, Sarah goes over Taylor's head and sics the medical board on Wendy for ethics violations.

Taylor learns of the maneuver directly from Wendy when they meet in the crowd at the boxing match. After a split second's hesitation, Mason rolls with it, claiming responsibility even though it was Sarah who must have pulled the trigger. Sarah, whose admiration for Taylor appears to be more than professional, appreciates the retroactive blessing for the attack. Wendy, of course, is guilty as sin. She knows it full well. Pep talks from both Bobby and Bonnie bounce right off her. As would-be clients refuse her services, Wendy admits she's shaken to her core about this -- more so, even, than by her husband's humiliating public revelation of their sexual kinks. That discrepancy is revealing in its own way. Sex, love and marriage are as important to Wendy as they are to anyone. But being stripped of her license to practice would be a direct hit on her deepest sense of self. Being a doctor matters to Wendy. Despite her shenanigans in service of her boss's and her husband's respective (and collective) schemes, she's still Dr. Wendy Rhoades. Losing that honorific would call her entire life's work into question. Kate Sacker is facing a similar internal struggle. Attorney General Jock Jeffcoat's current bugbear is mobile voting. His reasons are unclear to the other characters, though suppressing the votes of marginalized people is a tried and true tactic for good ol' boy politicians. Sacker has been a good soldier in Jeffcoat and Connerty's war against Chuck. But her skin instinctively crawls in response. For his part, Chuck combines political idealism with his desire to stick it to Jeffcoat and pushes for a mobile-voting pilot program among the Cayuga Nation people in upstate New York. This same group controls the casino that helped Charles Sr. rake in big real estate bucks ... and father a secret daughter with one of the locals, as Chuck learns to his chagrin. With the usual carrot-stick two-step, Chuck works with the tribe to get the pilot program greenlit.

In response, Jeffcoat moves against Rhoades's nominal ally, Commissioner Sansone. His threat to pull federal funding for the department's crown-jewel antiterror efforts and various other programs is enough to convince the Commish to shut down Charles Sr.'s waterfront construction project. Thrust and parry, jab and dodge, et cetera and ad nauseam. Directed by Colin Bucksey from a story by Lenore Zion and a script by Alice O'Neill, ""Fight Night"" is ""Billions"" at its most crisp, brisk and brutal. The twists and turns and pop-culture quotes are sumptuous, and every actor seems to appreciate the theatrical vibe of the project -- part Oscar Wilde, part Bernard Shaw -- a little more each week. But the toxicity of the politics underneath it all grows stronger with time as well. Voting rights, minority rights, the health of the environment, the sanctity of various and sundry offices -- everything we're trained, as citizens, to care about -- are playthings to these people. The message is clear: So are we.","Dollar Bill and Mafee go toe-to-toe, but the real bruising is taking place outside the ring.",c5cfa753-49ac-5d2f-bd5d-1213277c2902,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/05/watching/05billions-recap1/05billions-recap1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=7c8d0c80651bec57a92066ebf00dfa129aece829d5aeaf90d7728005c303d74a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Damian Lewis and Maggie Siff in a scene from ""Billions.""",c5cfa753-49ac-5d2f-bd5d-1213277c2902,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1c5cfa753-49ac-5d2f-bd5d-1213277c2902.jpg,3,8
Technology,The Coder and the Dictator,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/technology/venezuela-petro-cryptocurrency.html,"Gabriel Jimenez hated the Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro. But he loved cryptocurrency. When he built the regime a digital coin, he nearly paid with his life.

Just after midnight one Tuesday in early 2018, the vice president of Venezuela commandeered the nation's TV airwaves. Looking composed despite the hour, in a blue suit and red tie, he announced that the government was about to make history by becoming the first on Earth to sell its own cryptocurrency. It would be known as the Petro. Three blocks away, in the vice president's sprawling offices, Gabriel Jimenez was sitting blearily at an enormous glass conference table, pounding away at a laptop. Powerful air-conditioners chilled the air to a crisp. Lanky, with big black glasses set between a scruffy beard and a receding hairline, Mr. Jimenez had spent months designing and coding every detail of the Petro. Now, alongside his lead programmer, he was racing to make it operational, despite the fact that basic decisions had still not been made. Just after the vice president signed off the air, his chief of staff burst into the office, furious. Mr. Jimenez couldn't understand -- something about typos on a website, an embarrassment to the nation. The chief brought in two guards, armed with military rifles, and told Mr. Jimenez and his programmer that they were forbidden to leave. If they made any attempt to communicate with the outside world, they would be on their way to El Helicoide. It was a distinctly Venezuelan symbol of terror: a futuristic mall project, with car ramps between stores, converted into a political prison and center of torture.

Mr. Jimenez was finally released just before sunrise. When he made it to his apartment, he burst into sobs. Before he had time to collect himself, he got a call. The president himself, Nicolas Maduro, requested his presence. Mr. Jimenez walked to the presidential palace, pushing his way through the crowds outside with a sense of exhaustion and dread. A few months earlier, the idea that Mr. Jimenez would be called before the tyrant who ruled Venezuela would have been unimaginable. Mr. Jimenez was just 27, ran a tiny start-up, and had spent years protesting the dictator. Mr. Maduro had not just mismanaged his country into financial crisis -- he had detained, tortured and murdered those who challenged his power. But whatever Mr. Jimenez felt about the regime, he felt just as strongly about the potential of cryptocurrency. When the Maduro administration approached him about creating a digital coin, Mr. Jimenez saw an opportunity to change his country from within. If a national cryptocurrency was done right, Mr. Jimenez believed, he could give the government what it wanted -- a way to fight hyperinflation -- while also stealthily introducing technology that would give Venezuelans a measure of freedom from a government that dictated every detail of daily life. His friends and family warned him that working with the regime could only end badly. The person overseeing the effort, Vice President Tareck El Aissami, had been called a ""drug kingpin"" by the U.S. government and would soon be named to a federal ""Most Wanted"" list. Mr. Jimenez acknowledged the danger, but he talked about the Petro as a Trojan horse that would sneak in the kind of reforms that he and the opposition had been dreaming about for years.

Mr. Jimenez has been identified as the author of the Petro before, but he has never told his story. This account is based on hundreds of pages of confidential emails, text messages and government documents, as well as interviews with more than a dozen people who were involved with the project. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity because they still live in Venezuela, where openly criticizing the government can quickly lead to prison or death. A country in need of desperate ideas Mr. Jimenez was eight years old, living in the small city of El Tigre, when the military strongman Hugo Chavez came to power in 1998. A Marxist, Mr. Chavez used Venezuela's vast oil reserves to pay for social services for the poor, but he also made the country increasingly authoritarian, built around his own cult of personality. Mr. Jimenez was part of an educated class that was naturally drawn to the opposition. After college in Caracas, Mr. Jimenez spent a few years in the United States -- studying, getting married and doing what he could to oppose Mr. Chavez and his successor, Mr. Maduro. He also interned for a Republican congresswoman from Miami who regularly criticized the Venezuelan regime. When reformers won parliamentary elections in 2015, Mr. Jimenez felt compelled to return to his country to take part in the political opening. Here are more fascinating tales you can't help but read all the way to the end.
* None
* Getting Personal With Iman. The supermodel talks about life after David Bowie, their Catskills refuge and the perfume inspired by their love.
* A Resilient Team for a Broken Nation. With the Taliban in control, what, and whom, is Afghanistan's national soccer team playing for?
* The Fight of This Old Boxer's Life Was With His Own Family. A battle among   Marvin Stein's family over his fortune broke out, and he suddenly found himself powerless to fight for himself. Mr. Jimenez and his wife landed in Caracas in early 2016 and found a nation on the brink. Oil prices had plunged, sending Mr. Maduro into a money-printing frenzy. As bolivars became worthless, medicine disappeared, refugees drowned and children starved.

Mr. Jimenez was fairly insulated. He had founded a start-up, The Social Us, that connected Venezuelan programmers and designers with American companies looking for cheap labor. Like many wealthier Venezuelans, Mr. Jimenez kept almost all his money in dollars, but this made transactions a headache. He had to illegally swap currency every few days, and a taxi ride would require a stack of bolivars so thick that most drivers accepted only wire transfers. The situation rekindled Mr. Jimenez's long-running interest in cryptocurrencies. He began paying his employees in a digital coin; even with the crazy volatility of the crypto markets, it was more stable than a Venezuelan bank account, and it wasn't subject to the Maduro regime's diktats. The staff at The Social Us began touting cryptocurrency as a way for ordinary Venezuelans -- growing numbers of whom were buying Bitcoin on the street -- to deal with practical problems. One project they designed was a payment terminal that bypassed government limits on spending. Initially, the Maduro regime saw Bitcoin as a threat. The technology, after all, used a decentralized network to create and move money, and no authority was in charge. But then some members of the government noticed that this cut both ways. Cryptocurrency could also be a way for Venezuela to escape sanctions levied by the United States and international organizations. In September 2017, an official loyal to Mr. Maduro floated the idea of a digital currency backed by Venezuela's oil reserves. This was unorthodox: One of the tenets of Bitcoin is that its value does not derive from a natural resource or government fiat, only the laws of mathematics. But the distinction faded in the face of Venezuela's desperation. The official, Carlos Vargas, read about Mr. Jimenez's crypto work in a local publication and asked for a meeting. Soon the hulking form of Mr. Vargas arrived at the office of The Social Us. As he consumed an entire bag of potato chips, Mr. Vargas flattered the young digital workers, saying they were among the only people in Venezuela capable of creating what he had proposed. The idea was exactly what Mr. Jimenez had hoped to hear. The goal was to create a new Venezuelan currency that would move freely over an open network, like Bitcoin. The government would be unable to control -- or bungle -- it. Mr. Vargas wanted to call it the Petro Global Coin, but Mr. Jimenez suggested something simpler: the Petro. The Social Us put together a short pitch deck for the Petro project. But Venezuela is filled with people proposing crazy schemes, and Mr. Jimenez didn't put too much stock in it. Then, in early December, when Mr. Jimenez was at a conference in Colombia, he got an urgent text. Mr. Maduro had just announced a national cryptocurrency called the Petro. Mr. Jimenez threw open his laptop and found a video of the president, in his usual workman's shirt, telling a whooping crowd, ""This is something momentous.""

Mr. Jimenez dashed off a message to Mr. Vargas: ""Did they just steal our project?"" Mr. Vargas replied, ""This is the project. They just approved it. Come back right away."" Mr. Jimenez landed in Caracas late at night, and soon found himself on the phone with some government officials and Mr. El Aissami. The vice president had a reputation as the second-most brutal man in Venezuela. But as he began questioning Mr. Jimenez, it seemed that some strange power reversal had happened. The vice president was friendly and curious, and suggested that this was Mr. Jimenez's project -- they were just there to learn from him. Mr. El Aissami wanted to know how many Petros there would be, and whether new ones could be mined like Bitcoin. Mr. Jimenez thought that the officials didn't have a particularly clear idea of how cryptocurrencies worked. After the call, Mr. Jimenez emailed his employees to be at the office for an early meeting. When everyone had gathered, he stood on a desk and said they should drop all other projects and focus on the Petro. People were free to leave, he said, but if they did this right, it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to change Venezuela. ""We will liberate people from government controls,"" he said. One of Mr. Jimenez's employees quit on the spot, saying he could not tolerate working for a dictator. Beyond their office, the idea of a state-backed cryptocurrency -- nearly an oxymoron -- had already become the subject of derision among longtime advocates of a technology designed to avoid state power. As the group dispersed, one of Mr. Jimenez's closest friends, the creative director Daniel Certain, pulled him down for a conversation on the bright beanbags that were strewn around the office. ""Don't do this -- it's a bad idea,"" Mr. Certain told him. ""You are going to make us work for them, and they are going to take the project out of your hands when they find you are not useful anymore."" As Mr. Certain recalled, Mr. Jimenez laughed with characteristic hubris and said, ""Nobody else in Venezuela would even know how to do this.""

The air-conditioner above the door was buzzing. The president asked the vice president if he would fix it. In his Adidas track suit, he stood on the couch and whacked the unit a few times. For Mr. Jimenez, there was a certain comfort in seeing the lack of luxury, given the privation in the rest of Venezuela. Mr. Maduro told the group with a laugh that his announcement of the Petro had inspired cryptocurrency investors everywhere, and helped push Bitcoin to an all-time high of $20,000. It was unclear if he was joking, and everyone just chuckled. When the president gave Mr. Jimenez the floor, he went over the basics of the Petro, including an initial issuance of $200 million. Then the finance minister spoke up, and for the first time, Mr. Jimenez's plans were challenged. The minister took out a manila folder with a map of the Orinoco Belt and said he wanted the Petro to be backed on an ongoing basis by certain oil reserves there, which were worth orders of magnitude more -- many billions of dollars. Mr. Jimenez pushed back: It was one thing to tie the Petro's initial price to oil, but if it couldn't trade freely after that -- at whatever price investors felt it was worth -- then it wouldn't be a revolutionary product. A Petro whose price always reflected oil reserves would essentially be a bond, and recent sanctions made it illegal for Americans to buy those. The president didn't seem to follow the debate all that closely. As the group dispersed, Mr. Spanos did not have a good feeling about Mr. Jimenez's future. ""I thought he would become the scapegoat,"" he said later. ""I didn't think I'd see this kid again."" Before leaving Caracas, Mr. Spanos remembers telling Mr. Jimenez: ""I wish I had a magic carpet to get you out of here.""

'You cannot contradict the word of the president' Mr. Maduro ratcheted up his public campaign for the Petro. He didn't have many other tricks up his sleeve to combat hyperinflation, which in just four months had destroyed 90 percent of the value of the bolivar. Members of the opposition were openly calling for a coup. As Mr. Jimenez watched Mr. Maduro's televised talks, he was astonished by how much of what he had said at La Roca had gotten through to the president. Mr. Maduro mentioned Ethereum, white papers and transparency. But the speeches also made it clear to Mr. Jimenez that he was no longer in control of the Petro. Mr. Maduro announced that the currency would, in fact, be tied to a specific block of the Orinoco Belt -- exactly what Mr. Jimenez had argued against. He complained to Mr. Vargas, but was shot down: ""You cannot contradict the word of the president."" Mr. Vargas told Mr. Jimenez to rewrite the Petro's white paper to reflect Mr. Maduro's decision -- and to do it quickly. He and the vice president were about to travel to Turkey and Qatar to begin selling the Petro to investors. Things deteriorated rapidly. The president's excitement turned the Petro into a project that everyone wanted to get in on, and in mid-January 2018 a series of meetings at the ministry of finance turned contentious. The department's top economic adviser wanted the Petro to have a stable value, controlled by the government, with an option to trade it in for actual oil. Mr. Jimenez managed to push back, winning an agreement that oil could be used to create a minimum value the state would promise to honor, but that the price would also be allowed to fluctuate on open markets. He also made sure the Petro would exist on an open network of computers, tied to Ether, that would fundamentally limit the government's power to interfere. Eventually, Mr. Jimenez became convinced that he'd lose control of the project to the finance ministry. When he tried to resist sharing a digital copy of the white paper, he said, the minister told him by phone: ""You have to understand that this is now a project of the state. If you don't hand over the file, I won't be responsible for what happens to you."" Some of the staff at The Social Us worried that Mr. Jimenez's bullheaded desire to make the Petro happen put them all in danger. During another confrontation, Mr. Vargas had showed Mr. Jimenez blue folders containing intelligence dossiers compiled on the employees; after yet another dispute, triggered in part by the fact that the start-up had not been paid anything, the vice president sent word to Mr. Jimenez that he now considered him a traitor. It would have been reasonable at that point to assume that he was headed to prison, and that his role in the Petro was over. And yet Mr. Jimenez was pulled back into the program in a shambolic series of events. The government told his team that they would need to compete to have a role in the Petro's launch -- against a Russian group of murky origin. Mr. Jimenez's employees could find no evidence that they had any significant cryptocurrency experience; Time magazine later advanced a theory that they represented a Kremlin effort to control the Petro.

'I didn't know who my enemies were' At the palace, Miraflores, Mr. Jimenez was shown into the biggest ceremonial room, where the entire cabinet was waiting with Mr. Maduro. The president greeted him warmly, directed him to sit in the chair next to him and asked him how things had gone since their meeting at La Roca. Mr. Jimenez was aware of everyone else in the room, and the cameras capturing it all, so he didn't make reference to the events of the previous night, or any of the other funny business -- he just tried to emphasize that his team had a version of the Petro ready to go. ""I didn't know who my enemies were in there,"" he said later, recalling the event. ""I was the guy with no power."" After some chitchat, the president led everyone into a hall that had been converted to a Petro-themed television studio. With a crowd looking on, an M.C. called to the stage the Russians, and then Mr. Jimenez. He was presented with a pen and a contract. It was an agreement he had been refusing to sign for weeks which limited him to a role as a sales agent for the Petro -- a censure for his small acts of rebellion against the regime. On live television, Mr. Jimenez saw no way out. He scribbled his signature and gave a forced grin as photographers moved in. Mr. Jimenez took a seat and wondered what he had just done. The president said that Venezuela had already collected $725 million from investors. He thanked Mr. Jimenez by name, as well as The Social Us. ""It's a company founded and run by young geniuses from Venezuela,"" the president said. ""You stay crazy."" The Petro never really got off the ground. On March 19, President Trump signed an executive order barring Americans from using it. The same day, an Associated Press article about Mr. Jimenez noted that he had helped create the Petro for Mr. Maduro only a few years after interning for an anti-Maduro member of the House of Representatives. The congresswoman, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, immediately wrote a letter asking the Treasury Department to investigate ""whether Venezuelan national Gabriel Jimenez meets the criteria to be sanctioned under the appropriate authorities.""

Improbably, several countries had begun following Venezuela's lead and talking about launching their own government-sponsored digital currencies. China took the lead, and the European Central Bank said it was moving in the same direction. Venezuela relaunched the Petro a number of times, eventually coming out with a token given to pensioners that had none of the open properties from Mr. Jimenez's original design. In October, Mr. Jimenez heard that he got his American work papers. He wept tears of joy. Then he got started on a new project; it involves using cryptocurrencies to help Venezuelans avoid the bolivar. Mr. Jimenez still had essentially no money, but a crypto start-up in the San Francisco Bay Area allowed him to work out of its offices, eat from the fridge and stay on a couch in the chief executive's apartment. Recently, we met at a restaurant nearby. He pulled out a black notebook, in which he was writing letters of apology to the friends he had lost. ""I always thought that I could find a solution, to be able to compensate for my mistakes,"" Mr. Jimenez had written to one of his best friends. ""I know that some apologies are not enough. I know I even deserve some pain, but believe me that life has taken care of giving them to me.""","Gabriel Jiménez hated the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro. But he loved cryptocurrency. When he built the regime a digital coin, he nearly paid with his life.",d0670a68-a8b2-5b1c-9ff1-00f75f687f5e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/22/business/00PETRO-01/00PETRO-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=e25eaef59885fba09a8ff90d21911f42ed96852ecc526f754c9096d58926b5bd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Gabriel Jim&eacute;nez.,d0670a68-a8b2-5b1c-9ff1-00f75f687f5e,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1d0670a68-a8b2-5b1c-9ff1-00f75f687f5e.jpg,20,20
Technology,The Hard Part of Computer Science? Getting Into Class,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/computer-science-courses-college.html,"Computer science is so sought-after on certain college campuses that students like Aafia Ahmad, a sophomore and computer science major at the University of Texas at Austin, say they have to compete just to get into popular courses.

Lured by the prospect of high-salary, high-status jobs, college students are rushing in record numbers to study computer science. Now, if only they could get a seat in class. On campuses across the country, from major state universities to small private colleges, the surge in student demand for computer science courses is far outstripping the supply of professors, as the tech industry snaps up talent. At some schools, the shortage is creating an undergraduate divide of computing haves and have-nots -- potentially narrowing a path for some minority and female students to an industry that has struggled with diversity. The number of undergraduates majoring in the subject more than doubled from 2013 to 2017, to over 106,000, while tenure-track faculty ranks rose about 17 percent, according to the Computing Research Association, a nonprofit that gathers data from about 200 universities. Economics and the promise of upward mobility are driving the student stampede. While previous generations of entrepreneurial undergraduates might have aspired to become lawyers or doctors, many students now are leery of investing the time, and incurring six-figure debts, to join those professions.

By contrast, learning computing skills can be a fast path to employment, as fields as varied as agriculture, banking and genomics incorporate more sophisticated computing. While the quality of programs across the country varies widely, some computer science majors make six-figure salaries straight out of school. At the University of Texas at Austin, which has a top computer science program, more than 3,300 incoming first-year students last fall sought computer science as their first choice of major, more than double the number who did so in 2014. 



""The demand is unbounded,"" said Don Fussell, chairman of the university's computer science department. The university is looking to hire several tenure-track faculty members in computing this year, he said, but competition for top candidates is fierce. ""I know of major departments that interviewed 40 candidates, and I don't think they hired anybody."" Although the problem has been building for years, a recent boom is straining resources at new levels at institutions large and small. The situation has become so acute that Swarthmore College, which was already holding lotteries to select students for computing classes, is now capping the number of courses that computer science majors may take. The University of Maryland plans this fall to make computing a limited enrollment major, which will make it harder for non-majors to transfer in. At the University of California, San Diego, introductory lecture courses have ballooned to up to 400 students to accommodate both majors and non-majors.

As a result of such changes, students on some campuses said they felt shut out of computer science while others said they faced overcrowded classes with overworked professors. Aafia Ahmad, a sophomore computer science major at U.T. Austin, had hoped to take an elective course in computer security this semester. But when she tried to sign up during early registration in November, the course was already full. She said that was the case for nearly every computer science elective she wanted. She is now 79th on a waiting list for the security course. ""It's a cutthroat race to register for classes,"" she said. Some university leaders said they were concerned that certain measures taken to address surging student demand may disadvantage people who are already unrepresented in computer science -- including women, African-Americans, Latinos and low-income, first-generation college students. Some universities now require incoming students to get accepted into computer science majors before they arrive on campus -- and make it nearly impossible for other undergraduates to transfer into the major. That approach can favor incoming students from schools with resources like advanced programming courses. It can also favor male students -- because women on average are less likely to have taken a computer science course in high school. ""When you put any kind of barrier in place in terms of access to computer science majors, it tends to reduce the number of women and students of color in the program,"" said Maria Klawe, president of Harvey Mudd College, a private college in Claremont, Calif., that has become a national model for diversity in computer science.

""Maybe they are cutting off other options too early,"" said Richard Wicentowski, the chairman of Swarthmore's computer science department. One solution, he suggested: Universities could treat computer science more like math -- courses that lay the foundations for other majors like data science and physics. That way, he said, students could learn important computing skills and then apply them to other majors, like literature, while keeping their job prospects open. On some campuses, students have protested measures like course lotteries and long waiting lists. At Haverford College in Pennsylvania, students put up posters in the science building on April Fools' Day, lamenting the dearth of computing teachers. One showed a featureless face with the caption: ""This Is Where I'd Put My New Tenure-Track CS Professor ... If I Had One."" Students later wrote a letter to college officials pushing for more professors. Haverford has since opened a search for a new computer science professor. Some schools are trying to create more hospitable conditions. Both Harvey Mudd and the University of Washington in Seattle offer introductory computing courses intended to attract students with or without computing experience. Likewise, Tracy Camp, head of the computer science department at the Colorado School of Mines -- a public university where the number of computer science majors has more than doubled in recent years -- said she was determined not to put in deterrents like capping the major. Instead, she said, class sizes had sharply increased. ""I don't want to tell a student already at Mines, 'You can't major in computer science,'"" Professor Camp said.

""They are well aware that they are eating their seed,"" Professor Fussell said. Dr. Klawe at Harvey Mudd is weighing a more academic solution to meeting student demand. She wants to train people with Ph.D.s in subjects like math, physics and biology to teach computer science, potentially increasing the supply of professors. She is raising money for a pilot program, but she said any solution would take time. ""It's going to get worse before it gets better,"" Dr. Klawe said.","Student demand for computer science courses is outstripping the supply of professors, creating a student divide of computing haves and have-nots.",b9f5fa7d-0dbf-5f99-9f7d-af9c8e5e5aa3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/24/business/24CSLOTTERY-2-promo/23CSLOTTERY05-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=8dd500aa830843ef55333a3251ee44f45dda209462f9cfc775409dc09f69e959&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Computer science is so popular at the University of Texas that many students like Aafia Ahmad end up on class waiting lists.,b9f5fa7d-0dbf-5f99-9f7d-af9c8e5e5aa3,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1b9f5fa7d-0dbf-5f99-9f7d-af9c8e5e5aa3.jpg,20,20
Sports,Golf Rounds Surged as Coronavirus Advanced. Now the Game Is Retreating.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/sports/golf/golf-courses-open-coronavirus.html,"The Dalles Country Club in Oregon. Many courses saw an increase in play this month, ahead of increased restrictions on public gatherings.





Golf Rounds Surged as Coronavirus Advanced. Now the Game Is Retreating.

As recently as a week ago, recreational golfers flocked to the fairways of public and private golf courses as a respite from stay-at-home guidelines and lifestyle prohibitions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Golf, with its wide open spaces, still seemed safe. In New Jersey's Somerset County, the five municipal golf courses recorded 6,501 golf rounds in the first 19 days this month, a 300 percent increase over the number of rounds played in all of March last year. A similar surge in play, with players observing social distancing and other limits on close interactions, was happening all over the United States. ""The turnout almost overwhelmed us,"" said Matt Kammeyer, the director of golf for Salt Lake City's seven courses. ""Just a lot of happy, grateful people enjoying a round."" This week, it increasingly appears that golf's reprieve was short-lived. With stricter measures on public gatherings, our games, like everything else, live in realms of past and present.

""A few guys I play with are talking about going to Pennsylvania because some of their courses are open,"" Tom Avers, who plays about 100 rounds annually at the Somerset courses in New Jersey, said Monday morning. ""But I think they'll probably close down soon, too."" Kari Phenix, the head pro at the municipally owned Fort Myers Country Club in Fort Myers, Fla., said she was still seeing about 250 golfers at her course daily, but she wasn't sure how much longer that would last.

""It's day by day, who knows?"" she said. Fort Myers is home to the spring training complexes of the Boston Red Sox and the Minnesota Twins and is a popular winter destination for Canadians. But in a span of two weeks, the baseball fans and tourists have left. Nearby beaches, tennis courts and community pools have closed. Social gatherings at a voluminous number of retirement centers have been canceled. But thousands of retirees in the Fort Myers area have remained and been playing golf. ""It's mostly males, and a lot of them are widowed and don't have anything else to do,"" Phenix said. ""What are they supposed to do? It's walk, ride a bike and play golf. They're very thankful we're open -- everyone stops to say thanks."" For a while last week, the pandemic had spurred a few notable changes in the recreational golf world that would have been unimaginable a month ago. For example, golfers seemed less prone to grumpily bemoan their poor shots, cruel bogeys and heartless bounces.

""Complaints are way down,"" Bob Ransone, the deputy director of the Somerset park commission's golf division, said Saturday before his operations were closed. ""People are just too appreciative to be out in a beautiful environment."" Walking the course instead of driving a golf cart had become a new norm, something many in golf have advocated -- to no avail -- for decades because of the health benefits.

And the customarily rigid United States Golf Association, warden of golf's laborious rule book, even went out of its way last week to make the game, and its rules, easier. To minimize contact between golfers, most courses had closed clubhouses and snack bars, removed bunker rakes and ball washers, gone caddie-less and encouraged the use of online payment options. But one unsanitary condition of play remained: After putting out, golfers had to stick their hands into golf holes to retrieve their ball, after dozens of golfers had done so before them. Solutions proposed by golf superintendents soon abounded, including foam hole inserts that kept the ball near the top of the hole. Many golf courses even began raising the white liner cup, which is normally inserted into a hole, to about two inches above the ground. That way, an approaching ball could not fall into the hole but would instead bounce off the cup. On Friday, the U.S.G.A. temporarily amended its rules to say that a ball bouncing off a cup in such a manner would count as a sunk putt for official scorekeeping. Golf without close putts that pitilessly lip out? For a week, golfers had a new reason to smile. It is not clear when the majority of closed golf courses nationwide will reopen. Nor is it clear how long the courses that are currently open will remain so in many disparate regions of the country. Private golf clubs, where most clubhouses are already closed, may or may not discourage play, but it's unlikely that many will be willing to stop their members from walking onto the course with a golf bag. Golfers are also sneaking onto some public courses.

Dr. Kryssie Woods, an epidemiologist and director of infection prevention at Mount Sinai West, a medical center in Manhattan, wrote in an email on Sunday that golfers should heed the advice of government leaders and medical professionals by staying home. ""The more we embrace the advice to quarantine ourselves now, the sooner everyone will be able to resume normal life -- including getting back on the golf course,"" Woods wrote. Avers said that he accepted and understood the warnings and that he would heed them. ""I guess I'll do more landscaping and read a lot of books,"" he said. ""It's going to be pretty boring."" A week ago, the sun was out and Avers was on a golf course. Monday brought heavy rain and even snow to parts of the northeastern United States. ""It was great,"" he said. ""Now it stinks.""","Drawn by open-air acreage, free time and new social distancing guidelines, recreational golfers in the U.S. were playing in droves this month.

Food,The Freshest Ideas Are in Small Grocery Stores,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/dining/grocery-store.html,"As big supermarkets struggle, a new crop of local groceries are innovating to serve niche audiences and advance social causes.

BALTIMORE -- Maj. Gene Hogg, the Salvation Army's commander for central Maryland, organized mobile kitchens after the twin towers fell in Manhattan and the levees broke in New Orleans. He fed protesters and police officers during the riots that erupted here in 2015 after a young man named Freddie Gray died of injuries he received while in the back of a police van. More than 200 businesses were destroyed, many of them places where people bought food. Once the city calmed down, he pondered his next move. After three days of prayer and fasting, Mr. Hogg had an answer. ""God said I needed to open a grocery store,"" he said. It wasn't exactly what he had hoped to hear. What Mr. Hogg , 56, knew about grocery stores he could have scribbled on the back of receipt. Now, three years later, he can talk about produce and Pop-Tarts like a pro. On a recent Friday afternoon he bounded around the aisles of DMG Foods, a bright, 7,000-square-foot, nonprofit grocery store, showing a customer with a baby how to print a coupon and encouraging another to try the freshly ground chicken.

Most North Americans still buy their food at the classic supermarket, with its wide aisles and seemingly limitless choices. But stores like Kroger, the nation's largest chain with more than $105 billion in sales in 2017, are being cannibalized by a host of discount competitors like Dollar General and Aldi on one side, and by the growing dominance of Amazon and online delivery on the other. ""By and large, supermarkets are kind of behind the eight ball"" in responding to changes in how people shop, said Diana Smith, the associate director of retail and apparel for the market research company Mintel. Customers, especially younger ones, want stores that offer what some industry analysts have come to call ""food experiences,"" with craft beer on tap, meals to go and vegetable butchers. They tend to shop only when they cook, visiting more than one store to collect ingredients, rather than making a weekly trip to stock the pantry with toilet paper, chuck roast and gallons of milk.

""There's a lot of innovation that is geared toward bringing people together and back to their food, which is the opposite of the order-your-food-online thing,"" said Brianne Miller, 30, the founder and chief operating officer of Nada, a package-free grocery store she opened in June near downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, with her business partner, Paula Amiama. At Nada, everything, including toothpaste and chocolate, is sold package-free. Shoppers can buy scoops of frozen berries, a handful of crackers and just one egg, if that's all they need. There's no plastic wrap or paper at the deli counter. Customers bring their own containers, buy reusable ones at the store or take some from a stack that have been cleaned and sanitized, using a digital scale to weigh and tag them before they start shopping. The store won't be equipped to sell fresh meat, but will soon add cured meats and more frozen seafood (caught in a sustainable way, of course). Suppliers, too, have to be willing to reduce waste: A local coffee roaster, for example, delivers beans in refillable bulk containers.

Ms. Miller, a marine-mammal biologist who has a big vegetable garden and likes to bake, opened Nada after she saw how much plastic waste was choking the oceans. ""It was a leap of faith,"" she said. About 300 people showed up -- more than she expected -- to shop in the 2,332-square-foot store on its first day. Business continues to beat projections, and Ms. Miller has fielded more than 100 calls from people all over the world who want to know if she plans to franchise or who hope to open their own version. ""It just shows how much people want to buy their food this way,"" she said.

Two thousand miles away in New Prague, Minn., population around 7,600, Kendra and Paul Rasmusson have been inundated with inquiries from people equally enamored with their grocery concept: a store that is largely unstaffed. The couple's young daughter has epilepsy, and they discovered early on that a healthy diet could help her feel better. They couldn't find enough local, organic items at the big-box store close to town, and the nearest co-op was 20 miles away. So, almost three years ago, they opened Farmhouse Market. Ms. Rasmusson, 34, works part time as a marketing consultant and is the primary caretaker for their three young children. Her husband, 40, commutes 90 miles round trip for a banking job in Minneapolis. They calculated what it would take to open their own store, and realized the numbers wouldn't work if they were to run it in a traditional way. There just weren't enough customers.

Then, inspired by a nearby 24-hour fitness center, they had an idea: Why not create a store that didn't need staff, for shoppers who wanted organic ketchup, gluten-free crackers and vegetables from local farmers? Members pay $99 a year and use a key card to open the door. They can shop anytime they want. The system runs on a series of iPads and other devices. Lights are motion-activated, and checkout is done on a tablet. Local farmers, beekeepers and other suppliers have cards, too, so they can restock their supplies at midnight if they want. Ms. Rasmusson prices items from home, and texts orders to suppliers. Members can use a space upstairs for community meetings, or hold classes on making kombucha or Spanish for children. And the store is not completely unmanned. It is open to the public nine hours a week, with an actual cashier.

The grocery cost $2.2 million to set up, and his operating costs are low because the Salvation Army handles human resources and some other business operations. The power company takes a quarter off the energy bill. Donations and grants pay for education and training. ""We didn't do this to make money selling groceries,"" Mr. Hogg said. ""We did this so people could have a neighborhood grocery store with fresh food."" The city's food bank pitches in, so customers who say they are poor enough to qualify for government food stamps get a little something extra at the checkout counter. Sometimes it's 10 pounds of chicken, other times a small box of snacks. The store is intended to serve as a work-training site, and Mr. Hogg is planning cooking demonstrations to teach shoppers how to eat better. There are baskets of free fruit for children. Still, the store has plenty of chips and sodas. ""You can't tell people what to eat,"" he said, and choice is a matter of dignity when you're poor . So is the simple act of shopping. ""There's something about saying, 'I buy my own groceries,'"" he said. He and the managers are learning what customers want. They added Goya products, fresh ginger and tofu, which is popular with college students and older shoppers. Bagged salad mixes didn't sell, but prepared ones did. They added fried chicken along with rotisserie chickens, which at $4.99 are cheaper than at other grocery stores.

There are some surprises, like the popularity of fresh liver. ""We got no shrink on liver,"" said George Turner-El, the butcher, who never has to throw any out. People from the neighborhood who stopped in one day in July said they didn't expect the store to be so nice or so inexpensive. ""At first, we were like, 'What is this?'"" said Jamie Rogers, 31, who was shopping with her sister, Stephanie Rogers, 29. Jamie bought the ingredients for pepper steak and rice, and realized it cost her only $8. At Giant Food, she would have had to pay about $15 , and she would have endured a long walk there and back, she said. Carol Parker, the cashier, scanned their groceries.

Media,Canadian Journalist's Detention at U.S. Border Raises Press Freedom Alarms,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/business/media/canadian-journalists-detention-at-us-border-raises-press-freedom-alarms.html,"Ed Ou, a Canadian freelance photojournalist, spent 10 years covering the Middle East, Africa and Central Asia. He endured aggressive interrogations at border crossings in some of the world's most authoritarian nations. But he says a recent confrontation at the United States border has left him shaken. The incident has been criticized by advocates of privacy and press freedom. Mr. Ou, 30, said he was detained on Oct. 1 for more than six hours when he tried to fly from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Bismarck, N.D., to cover the protests of an oil pipeline project near the Standing Rock reservation. He was ultimately denied entry, and he said though he was not given a reason, he was told his name matched that of a ""person of interest."" During the hours of detention, he was asked to describe how and why he had traveled to each country he had visited in the past five years, and questioned about whether he had seen anyone die.

Agents requested access to his phones and to look through his photos so that they could make sure he was ""not posing next to any dead bodies,"" he said. When he refused, citing the need to protect his sources as a journalist, they took the phones, he said. The phones were later returned and showed signs that the SIM cards had been replaced, he said. Giving up the contents of his private phone would be akin to a doctor giving up confidential patient information, he said. ""I'm not going to open my phone for any other country,"" Mr. Ou, a New York Times contributor who was an intern for the news organization in 2010, said in a phone interview on Thursday from Nunavut, Canada. ""I can't be expected to do the same for the U.S."" Jason Givens, a United States Customs and Border Protection spokesman, declined to comment on Mr. Ou's case, citing privacy laws. But he said agents had inspected 4,444 cellphones and 320 other electronic devices in 2015, amounting to 0.0012 percent of the 383 million arrivals. ""Keeping America safe and enforcing our nation's laws in an increasingly digital world depends on our ability to lawfully examine all materials entering the U.S.,"" Mr. Givens said in a statement on Thursday.

The American Civil Liberties Union wrote a letter to Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security, protesting Mr. Ou's treatment and calling it ""harassing and exceptionally intrusive."" It demanded an explanation of his detention, and asked for a guarantee that any copies of his belongings had been destroyed. Agents made photocopies of several documents in his possession, including a personal journal, Mr. Ou said. It should have been clear to agents that Mr. Ou was a working journalist who had traveled freely to the United States in the past and had longstanding connections to American news agencies, Hugh Handeyside, a lawyer, wrote in the A.C.L.U. letter. ""We believe that C.B.P. took advantage of Mr. Ou's application for admission to engage in an opportunistic fishing expedition for sensitive and confidential information that Mr. Ou had gathered through his news-gathering activities in Turkey, Iraq, Somalia and elsewhere,"" he wrote.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Electronic privacy advocates said the episode illustrated a governmental loophole that's especially problematic for journalists but that could apply to anyone: Without a warrant, American border agents can legally search digital devices that they wouldn't be able to touch anywhere else. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, but the Supreme Court carved out space for border patrol agents to examine personal property without a warrant, said Sophia Cope, a staff lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit organization that defends civil liberties in the digital age.

Security officers at United States airports don't need a judge's permission to search a traveler's backpack before he or she boards a flight the way a police officer would when stopping someone on the street. But it has to be for the narrow purpose of assuring immigration or security compliance, she said. The privacy implications of examining a cellphone are entirely different from rifling through a suitcase, which contains limited personal information, Ms. Cope said. The law regarding digital devices is ""really unsettled,"" she said. ""The government is saying the old rule at the border applies to digital devices, even though our entire lives are on these devices,"" Ms. Cope said. A Homeland Security policy from 2009 says that searching digital devices requires the owner of the digital device to be present during the search, though it doesn't guarantee the owner can monitor the search. Agents can make copies of the data, but the copies must be destroyed within seven days if there is no probable cause to seize it. Devices can be detained for up to five days, barring ""extenuating circumstances."" The policy's assurance that agents would ""protect that information from unauthorized disclosure"" is not particularly comforting for journalists, who fear the contents of their devices could unmask sources who would be in danger if the government learned their identities. Maria Abi-Habib, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, recounted a similar episode in a Facebook post in July after she was detained at Los Angeles International Airport and asked to turn over her cellphones. The request was eventually withdrawn after Ms. Abi-Habib, a United States citizen traveling on an American passport, objected and asked to call lawyers for her newspaper. Trevor Timm, the executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said that for journalists like Mr. Ou who have worked in the Middle East to be treated with suspicion, potentially forcing them to break promises of confidentiality to sources just to enter the country, sets a poor international precedent, he said.","Border officials questioned Ed Ou, a freelance photojournalist, and confiscated his phones for a period before denying him entry.",2bc49ce8-b2a1-5338-af60-af9599ed5902,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/02/world/02EdOu_hp/02EdOu_hp-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=33c97eed467290e8a2c0e26f42221e5fdb5a19388e78f3f790d133433d6e0dff&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ed Ou, a Canadian photojournalist.",2bc49ce8-b2a1-5338-af60-af9599ed5902,Demo_data/D1_imgs/12bc49ce8-b2a1-5338-af60-af9599ed5902.jpg,16,20

Science,Geminids Meteor Shower 2020: Watch It Peak in Night Skies,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/science/geminid-meteor-shower.html,"All year long as Earth revolves around the sun, it passes through streams of cosmic debris. The resulting meteor showers can light up night skies from dusk to dawn, and if you're lucky you might be able to catch a glimpse. The next shower you might be able to see is known as the Geminids. Active from Dec. 4 to Dec. 20, it is expected to be at its peak from Sunday night into Monday morning, or Dec. 13 to 14. The Geminids, along with the Quadrantids that peaked in January, are thought to originate not from comets, but from asteroid-like space rocks. The Geminids are thought to have been produced by an object called 3200 Phaethon (an asteroid that a Japanese space mission, Destiny+, is to visit later this decade). If you manage to see them, this meteor shower can brighten the night sky with between 120 and 160 meteors per hour. While many showers are most visible after midnight and before dawn, the Geminids may be visible as early as 10 p.m. in some locations, according to the International Meteor Organization, although the best viewing may begin at around 11 and last until 4 a.m.

[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] Where meteor showers come from If you spot a meteor shower, what you're usually seeing is an icy comet's leftovers that crash into Earth's atmosphere. Comets are sort of like dirty snowballs: As they travel through the solar system, they leave behind a dusty trail of rocks and ice that lingers in space long after they leave. When Earth passes through these cascades of comet waste, the bits of debris -- which can be as small as grains of sand -- pierce the sky at such speeds that they burst, creating a celestial fireworks display. A general rule of thumb with meteor showers: You are never watching the Earth cross into remnants from a comet's most recent orbit. Instead, the burning bits come from the previous passes. For example, during the Perseid meteor shower you are seeing meteors ejected from when its parent comet, Comet Swift-Tuttle, visited in 1862 or earlier, not from its most recent pass in 1992. That's because it takes time for debris from a comet's orbit to drift into a position where it intersects with Earth's orbit, according to Bill Cooke, an astronomer with NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. The best way to see a meteor shower is to get to a location that has a clear view of the entire night sky. Ideally, that would be somewhere with dark skies, away from city lights and traffic. To maximize your chances of catching the show, look for a spot that offers a wide, unobstructed view. Bits and pieces of meteor showers are visible for a certain period of time, but they really peak visibly from dusk to dawn on a given few days. Those days are when Earth's orbit crosses through the thickest part of the cosmic stream. Meteor showers can vary in their peak times, with some reaching their maximums for only a few hours and others for several nights.

It is best to use your naked eye to spot a meteor shower. Binoculars or telescopes tend to limit your field of view. You might need to spend about half an hour in the dark to let your eyes get used to the reduced light. Stargazers should be warned that moonlight and the weather can obscure the shows. But if that happens, there are usually meteor livestreams like the ones hosted by NASA and by Slooh. The International Meteor Organization lists a variety of meteor showers that can be seen in 2020. Or you can find more information about some of the showers this year that are most likely to be visible below:","Meteor showers can light up night skies from dusk to dawn, and if you're lucky you might be able to catch a glimpse.",bd8aca0f-81f3-560c-a1ca-20fbefd4af67,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/19/science/space-calendar-geminids/space-calendar-geminids-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,A meteor from the Geminids streaking between the peaks of the Seven Sister rock formation in Nevada in 2010.,bd8aca0f-81f3-560c-a1ca-20fbefd4af67,Demo_data/D1_imgs/1bd8aca0f-81f3-560c-a1ca-20fbefd4af67.jpg,2,20
Opinion,The Justice Department's Shameful Rush to Federal Executions,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/opinion/justice-department-federal-execution.html,"Early on Tuesday morning, while much of the country was still asleep, the federal government executed its first death-row prisoner in 17 years. We are among the lawyers who represented the prisoner who was killed, Daniel Lee. Make no mistake: The circumstances of Mr. Lee's execution are a vivid illustration of the serious problems with the Trump administration's reckless push to bring back the federal death penalty. At nearly every turn, the Department of Justice disregarded the rule of law to rush through an execution that even the family of Mr. Lee's victims and the judge and prosecutor in his case opposed. On Monday morning, a federal court in Washington, D.C., concluded that the most current scientific evidence before it ""overwhelmingly"" demonstrated that the administration's lethal-injection procedures most likely violated the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits ""cruel and unusual"" punishment. The court said the evidence showed that prisoners executed using the government's chosen execution drug were at a serious risk of experiencing an excruciating sensation akin to drowning as their airways fill with foam. So the court put a halt to Mr. Lee's execution, which was scheduled for Monday at 4 p.m. It also halted two other federal executions planned for later this week and one next month. A unanimous D.C. Circuit panel upheld the injunction and set aside a highly expedited briefing schedule for the government's appeal.

Instead of disputing the court's findings through the ordinary judicial process, however, the Department of Justice took the highly irregular step of asking the Supreme Court for an emergency order that would allow the executions to proceed without further judicial review. On Tuesday morning at approximately 2 a.m., 10 hours after Mr. Lee's scheduled execution time, the Supreme Court issued a 5-to-4 decision overruling both the District Court and the D.C. Circuit and allowing the execution to proceed. Over separate dissents by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, the Supreme Court concluded that the prisoners were not entitled to ""last-minute intervention"" -- even though there was nothing ""last-minute"" about their request. The prisoners sought relief shortly after Attorney General William Barr announced a year ago that he intended to execute them. As Justice Sotomayor explained in her dissent, the Supreme Court's rushed ruling ""overlooked"" Supreme Court practice and amounted to an abdication of the court's ""role in safeguarding robust federal judicial review."" The Justice Department's request for emergency relief was of a piece with this administration's aggressiveness in short-circuiting the ordinary course of review and seeking relief directly from the Supreme Court. But that tactic carried unusually serious consequences here: As Justice Sotomayor noted, the dangers ""are particularly severe"" in death-penalty litigation because ""the grant of the government's emergency application"" inflicts ""the most irreparable of harms without the deliberation such an action warrants."" The government's haste to execute Mr. Lee, however, didn't stop there. Within minutes of the Supreme Court's decision, the Department of Justice rescheduled his execution -- for 4 a.m. the same morning -- and summoned media and witnesses back to the prison in the dark of night. But there was another problem: A court order halting the execution from a federal court in Arkansas still remained in place. After struggling to contact officials on site before the execution, Mr. Lee's lawyers were finally able to remind them of that order around 4 a.m. The Justice Department initially maintained that the court order presented no impediment to executing Mr. Lee, a position reflecting remarkable disregard for a coequal branch of government. As 4 a.m. came and went, however, the Justice Department -- under the threat of contempt sanctions -- decided to file an emergency motion to lift the court order blocking the execution.

Over the four hours it took for the government to pursue these ends, Mr. Lee remained strapped to a gurney -- with IV lines in his arms, according to a witness -- as a court decided his fate. Around 8 a.m., about 30 minutes after a federal court lifted the last ruling barring his execution, while multiple motions seeking a stay of the execution remained pending in federal court, and without any notice to counsel that the execution was occurring, Mr. Lee was put to death. He was executed nearly 15 hours after he was first scheduled to be strapped down inside the execution chamber. And media accounts suggest that he did not die immediately when the lethal injection was administered, potentially suffering from the very complication identified in his Eighth Amendment challenge. The Department of Justice's rush to conduct this execution makes plain its indifference to the basic rights of prisoners like Mr. Lee and to the ordinary judicial process that typically constrains the government in matters of life or death. Indeed, the consequences of this administration's execute-at-any-cost approach were laid bare once again on early Wednesday morning, less than 24 hours after Mr. Lee was put to death, when a federal court concluded that another of his outstanding challenges to his execution was likely to be meritorious. A unanimous D.C. Circuit panel upheld that ruling. Ultimately, following yet another ""emergency"" request from the government, the Supreme Court rejected that claim with another order issued in the middle of the night, clearing the way for the execution of a second prisoner, Wesley Purkey. But the government did not wait for that order to issue in Mr. Lee's case. He had already been executed. It is shameful that the government saw fit to carry out this execution during a pandemic, even after a government employee involved in preparing for the execution at the prison tested positive for the coronavirus. It is shameful that the government saw fit to carry out this execution when the prisoner's counsel could not be present with him and without notifying counsel during the execution itself. And it is shameful that the government saw fit to carry out this execution in haste, in the middle of the night. Whatever one's views of justice or capital punishment, this doesn't look like fairness or decency. The facts of Mr. Lee's case further underscore the flaws in the government's unyielding efforts to impose the death penalty. The government has long claimed that the death penalty is necessary to vindicate the interests of victims' families. But it ignored that family members of Mr. Lee's victims opposed his execution. Moreover, as Justice Breyer explained in his dissent, Mr. Lee's death sentence was arbitrarily imposed: His co-defendant was sentenced to life in prison even though the government described the co-defendant as the far more culpable ""ringleader."" Our experience with the first execution conducted by the Trump administration confirmed this much: Its new death-penalty regime is badly broken. Its unrelenting push to impose the federal death penalty no matter the cost poses a grave threat to the rule of law. For now, it will be up to the courts to push back against the government's lawless execution agenda.",The push to impose the federal death penalty no matter the cost poses a grave threat to the rule of law.,5da51505-585c-5c01-8f29-d78297ac0aa4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/16/opinion/16Stetson-Friedman/16Stetson-Friedman-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=03a706402f59eb425f4c08f13b624e2c8aa2a8af0e61f586de4d49131bd00dd9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The execution chamber in the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind.",5da51505-585c-5c01-8f29-d78297ac0aa4,Demo_data/D1_imgs/15da51505-585c-5c01-8f29-d78297ac0aa4.jpg,11,20
Style,How Do You Dress a Russian Doll?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/style/russian-doll-style-netflix.html,"What would you wear if you could attend your own funeral?

Don't ask Nadia, the tart protagonist of the Netflix series ""Russian Doll,"" who dies and springs back to life in each of the eight episodes, never surviving quite long enough to seriously ponder the question.

Chances are Nadia would deck herself out in some variation of her rock 'n' roll tomboy look, the raffish composite of tweed boy coat, black blazer, tie blouse and skinny jeans she wears to her job every day. It's an all-purpose getup, accessorized with steel-rimmed shades, an unruly mop of cherry-tone hair and an ever-present cigarette.

Her look is no fashion statement, truth be told. But then again, ""Russian Doll"" doesn't purport to be about fashion, a point of little concern to the viewers attempting to shop the show's wardrobe online.

Those watching attentively know that Nadia makes only minor wardrobe adjustments for her 36th birthday bash, given by her aggressively fashionable friend Maxine (Greta Lee).

Ms. Boone is scheduled to be sentenced later this month after pleading guilty last September to two counts of filing false returns for 2011 for herself and her gallery. Federal authorities had charged her with reporting a false business loss and claiming about $1.6 million in personal expenses as business deductions.

Each of the two counts carries a possible penalty of three years in prison.

But in a memorandum to Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan, Ms. Boone's lawyers asked that she be sentenced instead to home confinement and probation with up to 1,000 hours of community service. Her troubled and unstable childhood led to mental health issues, a suicide attempt and drug and alcohol abuse, they wrote, and played a role in the crimes she committed. In particular, they said the poverty of her early life had left her fearful that, despite her success, she would end up destitute and dependent upon others.
